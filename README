This project is to contain a set of programs that can be used to maintain my
personal taxonomic database of mammals. Currently, this database lives in a set
of spreadsheets, which makes it convenient to make small edits but hard to
make, large script-driven changes.

The intended structure of this application is as follows:
- A MySQL database with two tables (taxon and name) to serve as the persistent
  data store.
- A Python web application, written using the Pyramid framework, to serve the
  taxonomic data to a web interface and allow edits.
- A JavaScript application that allows viewing and editing on a web page.
- A PHP server (part of the separate EHPHP project) that can be used by this
  application to retrieve information from my bibliographic database program.
- A set of scripts in Python to import data from the existing spreadsheets
  into the database.
