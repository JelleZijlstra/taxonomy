# Finding citations

The content of the Hesperomys database is based on data from more than 50,000 citations,
most of which were found on the Internet. This page describes how I go about looking for
citations, and it can serve as a guide for finding old taxonomic literature in general.

An important date for finding old sources is 1923. In general, copyright law provides
that sufficiently old works enter the _public domain_, which means they lose copyright
protection and can be freely reproduced by anyone. For many years, United States
copyright law provided that all works published before 1923 were in the public domain.
As a result, publications from before 1923 are much easier to find online in many cases.
Beginning in 2019, a year's worth of works enter the public domain every January; as of
2024, works published up to 1928 are in the public domain. Works that are in the public
domain in the United States can usually (but not always) be found on US-based online
resources such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library, HathiTrust, and Google Books.

More recent works are still under copyright and generally can only be found online if
the copyright holder gave permission. Usually, journals are easier to find than books.
Over the past few decades, virtually all journals are published online, either open
access or behind a publisher's paywall. The period between the public domain cutoff date
and the advent of the Internet (roughly 1930–2000) tends to be when references are
hardest to find, but for many journals, the publisher has put old volumes online or
allowed resources such as the Biodiversity Heritage Library to do so.

## Resources

The following are some of the most important resources for finding references:

- [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) (BHL), a
  consortium of libraries dedicated to biodiversity literature. This is an amazing
  resource and the single most important source for literature. Useful features include
  curated bibliographic metadata, a simple feature for linking to individual pages, the
  availability of an API, and the ability to mark individual journal articles as
  separately downloadable "parts". The library's focus is on public domain data, and
  anything published before 1923 can very likely be found there. Not much progress
  appears to have been made with making works published in 1923–1928, which are now in
  the public domain, available. The library also contains some journals and books
  published after 1923 that were digitized with the permission of the copyright holder.
- [HathiTrust](https://www.hathitrust.org/) is a general literature repository. As far
  as I can tell its scanned books derive from Google Books, but it more consistently
  makes them available for download and contains better bibliographic metadata.
- [Google Books](https://books.google.com/) contains a very large number of books, and
  public domain works are usually available in full view and downloadable. This is
  usually my second stop after BHL if I need to find a book. It has the best search
  function of any of the resources listed here, but the bibliographic metadata are
  spotty.
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/texts) provides a large number of books and
  other texts. Among others, it provides backend storage for BHL, so BHL works also show
  up on Archive.org. However, it also contains some works that are not in BHL.
- [Gallica](https://gallica.bnf.fr/), a website by the National Library of France,
  provides a lot of literature, mostly but not entirely from France, including many
  works that are not available elsewhere. The search function is not great and the
  website is relatively difficult to navigate.
- [Zobodat](https://www.zobodat.at/), an Austrian website, provides structured
  bibliographic data for many Austrian and German journals.
- [JStor](https://www.jstor.org/) is a general literature repository. Public domain data
  is open access; newer literature is only accessible with appropriate credentials. The
  database primarily contains American journals, but also some books and data from other
  countries.
