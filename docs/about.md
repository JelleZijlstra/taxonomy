# About

I am Jelle Zijlstra, the creator and maintainer of the _Hesperomys_ Project. I got interested in mammals
and taxonomy at an early age and started doing paleontological research in high school. I moved to the
United States for college and I currently live in California, where I work for
[Quora](https://www.quora.com) as a software engineer.

I started the database as a child after I acquired a book that purported to list all known species of
birds. I figured the birds were already done, so I should work on something else and picked mammals. I quickly
lost any interest I may have had in birds. Using various books and websites, I put together a spreadsheet that
I proudly named "4611 Dieren" (4611 Animals) because it listed 4611 species of extant mammals. But as I put
together the list, I started learning about issues of taxonomy (different lists disagreed on which species were
valid) and synonymy (sometimes old books listed names that were no longer in use). I started collecting
taxonomic literature in order to make more informed decisions, and adding synonyms to the database so I could
figure out what my old books were talking about.

Over the years, I worked on the database on and off and it grew in size and scope. In college I learned
programming and started writing tools to make it easier to maintain my giant spreadsheets of mammals and
citations. After college I learned software engineering, got rid of my old PHP code, and converted the whole
thing into a proper database.

In 2018, while on vacation in China, I read the whole International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and
used it as a guide to refine the information I would include in my database: type localities, type specimens,
type species designations, and other data important to nomenclature. Since then I have worked on filling out
the database to these specifications, and what you see today is the result.

## My research

In both high school and college, I was able to do paleontological research thanks to the kindness of
researchers who invited me to join their labs and gave me boxes of little fossil teeth to look at. I am grateful
to them for the opportunity to see real fossils and learn what research is like.

In high school I worked at [Naturalis](https://www.naturalis.nl/) with
[Lars van den Hoek Ostende](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lars_Van_den_Hoek_Ostende). I spent some time
looking at [_Deinogalerix_](/t/Deinogalerix) and at [Flores](/r/Flores) rodents such as [_Papagomys_](/t/Papagomys),
but my main research there was on the fossil rodents of the Caribbean, including the new genera
[_Agathaeromys_](/t/Agathaeromys), [_Cordimus_](/t/Cordimus) and [_Dushimys_](/t/Dushimys).

[Larry Flynn](https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/people/lawrence-flynn) at the [Peabody Museum](https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/)
allowed me to study the fossil insectivores from the [Siwalik Group](/p/Siwalik_Group) of Pakistan in his care. Thanks
to [Wilma Wessels](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilma-wessels-16268b28/) of Utrecht University, I was also able to
incorporate a collection from the [Manchar Formation](/p/Manchar_Formation) into my research. This resulted in
the discovery of the erinaceid [_Galerix wesselsae_](/t/Galerix_wesselsae) and of the first tarsier from Pakistan,
[_Hesperotarsius sindhensis_](/t/Hesperotarsius_sindhensis).

In addition to specimen-based research, I have a few publications dealing with purely nomenclatural matters like
homonyms. Most recently, I discovered during work on this database that a monkey species was named 25 years later
than generally thought, and I published a paper about this. I have published the following papers:
