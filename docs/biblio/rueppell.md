# Rüppell's _Atlas zu der Reise im nördlichen Afrika_

Eduard Rüppell was a German naturalist who was among the first to record the animals of
various parts of northeastern Africa. The work _Atlas zu der Reise im nördlichen Afrika_
was started by Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar while Rüppell was in the field, and later
continued by Rüppell himself when he returned to Germany. The mammal section has "1826"
on the cover, but many species in it are often cited to later years, which prompted me
to look into the work in more detail.

## Contents

The [copy in BHL](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/37140595) starts with a title
page that reads "Atlas / zu der Reise im nördlichen Afrika / von / Eduard Rüppell. /
Erste Abtheilung / Zoologie.", with the year 1826. This is followed by a dedication to
the Senate of Frankfurt, and a foreword (pages i-vi) signed by Cretzschmar, March 1826.
The various sections follow, each separately paginated and starting with another title
page:

- "Säugethiere", by Cretzschmar, dated 1826. 30 plates, 78 pages.
- "Vögel", by Cretzschmar, dated 1826. 36 plates, 55 pages.
- "Reptilien", by C. H. G. von Heyden, dated 1827. 6 plates, 24 pages.
- "Neue wirbellose Thiere des rothen Meers", by Rüppell himself and Friedrich Sigismund
  Leuckart, dated 1828. 12 plates, 47 pages, plus 3 unnumbered pages with figure legends
  and errata.
- "Fische des rothen Meers", by Rüppell, dated 1828. 35 plates, 141 pages.

This adds up to 345 numbered pages and 119 plates.

## Secondary and primary sources

{Animalia-index (A-Aff).pdf} p. lvi writes "Atlas to Rueppel's Reise im Noerdl. Afrika.
fo. F. a/M. 1826-31. [For dates see Isis, XXII, 1829, 1291; it was finished in 20 parts
by 1831.]"

{Aves-dating.pdf} pp. 84–85 summarizes aspects relevant to birds and lists the parts
that contain birds. They write that the work was published in 20 parts ("Lieferungen" or
"Hefte") of 6 plates each (almost consistent with the total of 119 plates), and each
plate was issued together with the corresponding text. They refer to various earlier
sources, but these were also focused on birds only. I have seen {Aves Ethiopia-Rueppell
nomenclature.pdf} but not the other sources cited. This paper indicates that parts 5, 7,
8, and 14 were examined in the original wrappers.

{Placentalia S Africa (Meester et al. 1986).pdf} p. 1 writes "J. E. Hill (in litt.)
kindly provided us with ... unpublished notes by T. C. S. Morrison-Scott, giving the
dates ofCretzschmar's descriptions of mammals in Rüppell: _Atlas zu der Reise im
nördlichen Afrika_."

Other secondary sources were less helpful but are listed here for completeness.
{Library-BMNH catalog 2.pdf} p. 612 merely recounts the imprint dates. {Mammalia
Australia (Jackson & Groves 2015).pdf} cites the mammal section to 1826–1831 but gives
no details.

Sherborn's reference to "Isis" is {Vertebrata-Rueppell review (Isis).pdf}, an anonymous
review of the work up to 1829, including a very useful list of parts and the plates they
contain. I also found several other contemporary references in various magazines, listed
below.

## Data

As the plate numbers repeat in the section, we use the codes "M" (mammals), "B" (birds),
"R" (reptiles), "I" (invertebrates), and "F" (fish).

Data from {Vertebrata-Rueppell review (Isis).pdf}:

- Heft 1: pl. M1-4, B1-2
- Heft 2: pl. B3-8
- Heft 3: pl. M5-M10
- Heft 4: pl. B9-15
- Heft 5: pl. M11-13, R1-2
- Heft 6 (1827): pl. M14-15, B16-B18, R3
- Heft 7 (1828): pl. M16-18, B19-21
- Heft 8 (1828): pl. M19-20, B22-25
- Heft 9 (1828): pl. I1-6
- Heft 10 (1828): pl. F1-6
- Heft 11 (1828): pl. M21-26
- Heft 12 (1829): pl. F7-12
- Heft 13 (1829): pl. F13-18
- Heft 14 (1829): pl. B26-B31
- Heft 15 (1829): pl. F19-24

Dates for parts 1–5 are not given because they were covered in an earlier number of
Isis. The second Heft listed under mammals is numbered "VII", but from context this must
be III (Heft III is not otherwise listed, and II and IV are listed with bird contents).

Data from {Aves-dating.pdf}:

- Heft 2 (1826): pl. B1-5, pp. 1-8
- Heft 3 (1827): pl. B6-8, pp. 9-12
- Heft 4 (1827): pl. B9-12, pp. 13-20
- Heft 5 (1827): pl. B13-15, pp. 21-24
- Heft 6 (1827): pl. B16-18, pp. 25-28
- Heft 7 (1828): pl. B19-21, pp. 29-32
- Heft 8 (1828): pl. B22-25, pp. 33-38
- Heft 14 (1829): pl. B26-32, pp. 39-48
- Heft 18 (1830): pl. B33-36, pp. 49-55

While the dates for each part agree, the contents do not. Both sometimes break the
supposed rule that each part has 6 plates: Heft 14 in {Aves-dating.pdf} has 7 and Heft 5
in {Vertebrata-Rueppell review (Isis).pdf} has 5.

Differences between {Aves-dating.pdf} (D) and {Vertebrata-Rueppell review (Isis).pdf}
(I):

- I places B1-8 in Heft 1/2; D places them in Heft 2/3
- I places B9-15 in Heft 4; D divides them among Heft 4/5 (said to have been confirmed
  by the original wrappers)
- Hefte 6-8 (pl. B16-25) are in agreement
- D includes B32 in Heft 14; I does not

## Conclusion

While some of the data are conflicting and other data are incomplete, there is enough
evidence to piece most of it together. We have to consider two separate questions: (a)
What was in each of the 20 parts? (b) When was each part published?

### Contents of parts

For the contents of the various parts, we have a lot of data from the 1829 _Isis_ review
(up to Heft 15) and from {Aves-dating.pdf} (birds only), and scattered data from other
reviews, mostly at the beginning and end of the book. The _Isis_ review's claim that
Heft 1 contained bird plates is confirmed by other contemporary reviews, and
pragmatically the _Isis_ review is easier to build on because it has data for groups
other than birds, so I use it as a basis for dating the rest of the volume. It is
possible that {Aves-dating.pdf} is right about the division between parts 4 and 5,
because the _Isis_ review puts 7 plates in part 4 and only 5 in part 5.

However, the _Isis_ review only covers parts up to 15. For the rest, we have to allocate
plates M27-30, B32-36, R4-6, F25-35, I7-12. The August 1831 _Bulletin des Sciences
Naturelles et de Géologie_ has data for the last three parts (there numbered 25-27,
which is presumed to be a mistake for 18-20). Other data cited below indicate that part
16 contains fish and part 17 contains invertebrates. It is not clear what happened to
plate B32; it is not listed in the _Isis_ review (contra {Aves-dating.pdf} which puts it
in part 14), but also not listed in the _Bulletin_ review. It is listed in the earlier
_Bulletin_ review of birds, so must have been published by July 1830. I tentatively
associate it with part 14.

We can therefore assume that the contents of the parts are as follows:

- Heft 1: pl. M1-4, B1-2
- Heft 2: pl. B3-8
- Heft 3: pl. M5-M10
- Heft 4: pl. B9-15 (7 plates)
- Heft 5: pl. M11-13, R1-2 (5 plates)
- Heft 6: pl. M14-15, B16-B18, R3
- Heft 7: pl. M16-18, B19-21
- Heft 8: pl. M19-20, B22-25
- Heft 9: pl. I1-6
- Heft 10: pl. F1-6
- Heft 11: pl. M21-26
- Heft 12: pl. F7-12
- Heft 13: pl. F13-18
- Heft 14: pl. B26-B31 (and 32?)
- Heft 15: pl. F19-24
- Heft 16: pl. F25-30
- Heft 17: pl. I7-12
- Heft 18: pl. M27-28, B33-36
- Heft 19: pl. M29-30, R4-6 (only 5)
- Heft 20: pl. F31-35 (only 5)

### Dates

The whole work is conventionally dated to 1826–1831, but the evidence for the beginning
and end of the range is somewhat weak. We can date the parts as follows:

- Heft 1: 1826 (_Isis_, 1826; other references start in mid-1827)
- Heft 2: 1826 (_Isis_, 1828, citing this part as 1826)
- Heft 3: by 14 October 1827 (_Oesterreichischer Beobachter_)
- Hefte 4–6: 1827 (_Isis_, 1829)
- Hefte 7–11: 1828 (_Isis_, 1829)
- Hefte 12–15: 1829 (_Isis_, 1829)
- Hefte 16-17: by October 1830 (_Bulletin_, 23:134)
- Hefte 18-20: by August 1831 (_Bulletin_, 26:185)
  - However, contemporary sources date all these parts to 1830, and {Aves-dating.pdf}
    allocates part 18 to 1830.
