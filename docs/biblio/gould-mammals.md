# Gould's _Mammals of Australia_

John Gould's _Mammals of Australia_ was published from 1845 to 1863 in 13 parts. The
librarian F.R. Waterhouse published an admirable volume datailing the publication dates
of Gould's works {Vertebrata-Gould publication dates.pdf}, and here I provide only a
brief summary.

The book was published in 13 parts over the period 1845 to 1863. The last part contained
the introduction and lists of plates with numbers; the numbers do not appear on the
plates themselves and there is no relationship between the sequence of numbers and the
sequence of publication.

## Treatment in the database

The work as a whole is cited as:

- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1845-63)!r}

The three volumes are:

- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1).pdf!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 2).pdf!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 3).pdf!r}

However, these are not cited as original publications, because the division into volumes
does not match the actual sequence of publication.

The thirteen parts are:

- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1845) (part i)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1849) (part ii)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1851) (part iii)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1852) (part iv)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1853) (part v)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1854) (part vi)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1855) (part vii)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1856) (part viii)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1857) (part ix)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1858) (part x)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1859) (part xi)!r}
- {Mammalia Australia (Gould 1860) (part xii)!r}
