# Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London

The [_Proceedings_](/cg/1) were one of the most important venues for publishing new
species in 19th-century Britain.

For most of its lifetime, the journal lacked explicit volume numbers; each volume
contained the papers presented in the Society's meetings during a particular year.
However, the publication of the printed volume often happened considerably later. A
useful overview of the early history of the journal is [Duncan (1937)](/a/14498), with
additions by [Cowan (1973)](/a/59416) and [Dickinson (2005)](/a/14497). These sources
provide precise dates of publication for all volumes from 1861 to 1925; before 1861 the
data is fuzzier.

The precise title varied, but the journal is usually (including in this database)
referred to as _Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London_ throughout its history:

- _Proceedings of the Committee of Science and Correspondence of the Zoological Society
  of London_ (1831–1832; [Stanford](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10156443))
  - Parts 1 and 2
- _Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London_ (1833–1860;
  [Stanford](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10156446))
  - Yearly volumes were numbered as parts 1–28. I believe they are more commonly
    referred to by their years.
- _The proceedings of the scientific meetings of the Zoological Society of London_
  (1861–1890; [Stanford](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10156448))
  - Up to 1873 volumes were issued in three parts, afterwards in four
- _Proceedings of the general meetings for scientific business of the Zoological Society
  of London_ (1891–1936; [Stanford](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10156452))
  - During the years 1901–1905, two volumes were published each year with independent
    numbering. I refer to these as "1901-I" and "1901-II".
  - During 1917–1920 fewer than four parts were published, as some parts were combined.
- Split into series A and B (1937–1944), now with volume numbers (107–113) instead of
  just years
  - _Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Series A, General and
    experimental_ ([Stanford](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10156470))
  - _Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Series B, Systematic and
    morphological_ ([Stanford](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10156473))
  - According to the Stanford catalog series A and B start with vol. 107, pt. 2. I do
    not know what became of pt. 1.
- _Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London_ (1944–1965, volumes 114–145,
  [Stanford](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10156483))
- [_Journal of Zoology, London_](/cg/693) (starting 1965, vol. 146,
  [Stanford](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/401297))
  - Later again temporarily split into series A and B (1985–1987)

Separate [_Abstracts of the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London_](/cg/38)
were issued for some time, at least 1897 to 1933, often providing an earlier date of
publication for names more fully described in the _Proceedings_. I have often found it
difficult to locate these publications.
