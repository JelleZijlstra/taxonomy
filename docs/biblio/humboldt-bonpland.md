# Humboldt and Bonpland's _Recueil d'observations_

After the famous German explorer Alexander von Humboldt visited South America, he
published an account of the results of his journey, including several dealing with
zoology. Most relevant for mammals is the first volume, entitled _Recueil d'observations
de zoologie et d'anatomie comparée, faites dans l'Océan atlantique, dans l'intérieur du
nouveau continent et dans la mer du sud pendant les années 1799, 1800, 1801, 1802 et
1803_. It contains a number of descriptions of new species Humboldt saw, primarily
monkeys, as well as a concise review of all New World monkeys ("Tableau synoptique des
singes de l'Amérique", pp. 353–363). This volume bears the date 1811 on its title page,
but the truth appears to be more complicated.

The following secondary sources are relevant:

- {Animalia-Humboldt Bonpland dates (Sherborn 1899).pdf}
  - Gives dates for the zoological portions of the work.
- {Animalia-Humboldt Bonpland dates (Sherborn 1901).pdf}
  - Very similar but extends the account to cover botany.
- {Library-BMNH catalog 2.pdf}
  - pp. 890-891 list the BMNH's holdings relating to this work, and give references to
    bibliographical reviews.
- {Theria South America-new (Thomas 1913b).pdf}
  - p. 567 includes a footnote with the correct date for part of the work.

  - Announces the appearance of livraison 7 of the work on August 7, 1812.

Sherborn's research indicates that much of the volume was published twice. Livraisons 1
through 6 were published in 1805 through 1809, comprising a total of 412 pages. After a
gap, livraison 7 appeared in 1812, comprising a reprint of the first six livraisons (309
pages), plus additional material comprising a total of 368 pages. This work is dated
1811 on the title page, but its appearance in the _Bibliographie de l'Empire français_
of August 7, 1812, indicates that it was not issued until later.

Various scans of the 1812 edition of the work are available online:
