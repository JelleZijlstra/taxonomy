# _Erebus_ and _Terror_

The report of the 1839–1843 expedition by HMS _Erebus_ and HMS _Terror_, the
[Ross expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_expedition), has given rise to some
bibliographic confusion. The work was published under the title _The Zoology of the
Voyage of H.M.S. Erebus & Terror, under the command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross,
R.N., F.R.S., during the years 1839 to 1843_ from 1844 to 1875.

A few of the confusing aspects are:

- There was about a 30-year gap between the publications of the parts of the treatise on
  "The seals of the Southen Hemisphere", with pages 1–8 being published in 1844 and
  pages 9–12 in 1875. However, some authors cite 1844 for the whole treatise.
- Similarly, while some of the plates for the work were published in the 1840s, others
  were not published until 1875.
- Bibliographic sources ({Animalia-Erebus & Terror dates (Evenhuis 2015).pdf};
  {Animalia-Erebus & Terror bibliography (Rosove 2021).pdf}) disagree on the division
  into parts and the dates of publication of the work.
- Page and plate numbers are not contiguous even within the mammal section.

Here I briefly review the contents of the work, then look at the previous bibliographic
sources that discussed the work, then lay out the treatment used in this database. I
will consider only the mammal section for now.

### Contents

As the Ross expedition focused on Antarctica, most of the mammal section concerns marine
mammals, but there are also some newly named land mammals from Australia. The text is
divisible into three logical divisions:

- "The seals of the southern Hemisphere", pages 1 through 12. Named, among others,
  [_Ommatophoca rossii_](/t/Ommatophoca_rossii).
- "Miscellanea", pages 12a through 12d, concerning terrestrial mammals mostly from
  Australia.
- "On the cetaceous animals", pages 13 through 53, a full review of the Cetacea that
  introduced numerous names that are still considered valid.

Two differently numbered series of plates:

- Main series: plates 1 through 29, where plates 1 through 17 concerns seals and plates
  18 through 29 concern terrestrial mammals. Plates 11, 12, 13, 23, and 24 are
  apparently missing.
- For whales: plates 1 through 37, plus 32 _bis_, and an unnumbered plate of _Balaena
  antipodarum_

To avoid confusion, I will refer to the main series as plates M1 through M29 (for
"Mammalia") and the whale series as C1 through C37 (for "Cetacea").

### Previous work

Two articles provide detailed bibliographical accounts of the _Erebus and Terror_:

- {Animalia-Erebus & Terror dates (Evenhuis 2015).pdf}
- {Animalia-Erebus & Terror bibliography (Rosove 2021).pdf}

They agree on the following points:

- The work was issued in numbered parts, conventionally numbered in Roman numerals as I
  through XXIV. Some parts were published separately; at other times, groups of two or
  three parts were published together.
- Parts I through XVIII were published in 1844–1848. After a long gap, the final parts
  XIX through XXIV were published in 1874–1875.
- The mammals were published in four parts:
  - Part I: June 1844
  - Part IV: December 1844
  - Parts XIII–XV: August 1846 (Rosove) or 14–29 January 1847 (Evenhuis)
  - Part XXIII (May 1875)

However, the two references differ in what was published in each part. Evenhuis divides
the work as follows:

- Part I: pp. 1–8, ppl. M1–M10
- Part IV: pp. 13–53, ppl. C1–C37
- Part XIII–XV: reprinting of part IV, no new content
- Part XXIII: pp. 9–12, 12a–12d, ppl. M14–M28

Rosove's division is as follows:

- Part I: pp. 1–4, ppl. M3–M10, M14, M16
- Part IV: pp. 5–8, ppl. M1, M2, M15, M17, M18–M22, M25
- Part XIII–XV: pp. 13–53, ppl. C1–C30
- Part XXIII: pp. 9–12, 12a–12d, ppl. M26–M29, C31–C37, unnumbered plate of _Balaena
  antipodarum_

### Primary sources

Evenhuis makes references to "_Muquardt's Monthly Circular_", a work that was difficult
to track down. It appears to refer to "A Monthly List of New Books Published in Great
Britain, sold by Mr. C. Muquardt". I found a copy on Google Books that I refer to as
{Muquardt-catalogue.pdf}; it is a catalog of books sold by the bookseller C. Muquardt in
Brussels, covering the years 1844 through 1855. The first entry, for January 1844, is
entitled "new series–No. XVIII", indicating that Muquardt began publishing the list
earlier, but I have not attempted to track down earlier entries. References to the
_Erebus and Terror_ relevant to mammals are:

- No. 21, p. 83 (April 1, 1844) announces the impending publication of the work
- No. 22, p. 87 (May 1, 1844) announces Part I will appear on June 1
- No. 23, p. 92 (June 1, 1844) lists Part I as having been published during May. It
  contains the "vierfüssige Thiere" and is "erläutert durch colorirte Tafeln".
- No. 24, p. 94 (July 1, 1844) lists "Part I–Mammalia, by J. E. Gray. 4to. pp. 16, 16
  plates, sewed".
- No. 29, p. 116 (Dec. 2, 1844) lists "Part 4, the Mammalia, by John Edward Gray, Esq.
  royal 4to, 10 s. sewed" as having been published during November.
- No. 45, p. 218 (Feb. 1, 1847) lists "Parts 12, 13, 14, and 15" as being for sale and
  having been published during January.
- No. 60, p. 244 (Aug. 2, 1847) lists "Parts 13, 14, and 15, Mammalia (Nos. 3, 4, and
  5), by John Edward Gray, Esq. with numerous Plates" as having been published during
  July. Contra Evenhuis, there is no explicit indication that this is a reprint.

{Mammalia-for 1846 (Wagner 1847).pdf}, a summary of the literature for the year 1846, is
a useful independent summary. Wagner gives the following pertinent information:

- 3 parts about mammals had been published
- The text of the first two concerns seals; the third concerns whales
- The plates depict terrestrial mammals. Wagner explicitly cites plates 18, 19, 20, 21,
  22, and 25 with the correct scientific names for the depicted animals.

### Discussion

The most surprising point of agreement is that pp. 1–8 of "The seals of the southern
Hemisphere" (1844) were published 31 years before pp. 9–12 (1875). On a first look at
the work, this is difficult to believe, as p. 8 ends in the middle of a line of synonymy
with a comma, and the line is completed on p. 9. Nevertheless, internal evidence in the
work agrees with this division. P. 9 cites "Suppl. Cat. Seals and Whales Brit. Mus.",
which is {Cetacea, Pinnipedia-in BMNH (Gray 1871).pdf}, as well as other works published
in 1869 and 1874. However, p. 8 gives no literature references for _Ommatophoca Rossii_,
and as early as {Pinnipedia-in BMNH (Gray 1850).pdf}, Gray cites the name from the
_Erebus and Terror_.

Among the disagreements are:

- Was "The seals of the southern Hemisphere" pp. 1–8 published in its entirety in part I
  (Evenhuis), or divided into parts I and IV (Rosove)? This is of relatively minor
  significance (it affects only the month of publication within 1844). Muquardt's
  listing for July 1844 ("pp. 16, 16 plates") appears more consistent with Rosove's
  claim. In addition to mammals, Part I contained an introduction to the work on pages
  numbered v through xii (presumably pp. i–iv were the original front matter). 12 pages
  of introduction plus 4 pages of seals makes 16 pages total. Evenhuis gives 10 plates
  to part I and Rosove gives 8 discontinuously numbered plates, the highest number
  being 16.
- Was "On the cetaceous animals" published in part IV (1844) or XIII–XV (1846)? As noted
  by {Odontoceti-nomenclature (Jefferson 2021).pdf} p. 79, this work contains numerous
  references to events from 1845 and 1846, so it cannot have been published in 1844.
  Evenhuis's claim that parts XIII–XV were a reprint of part IV cannot be verified in
  the source (see above), as Murquart separately lists parts 12–15 as having been
  published by February. It is possible that the parts were reissued during the summer
  of 1847, but there is no conclusive evidence for this.
- When exactly were parts XIII–XV published? The latest definite date in the work itself
  is May 4, 1846, when a _Balaena mysticetus_ was towed into Liverpool (p. 47). Rosove
  gives August 1846 with no further justification. Evenhuis cites "Publ. Circular No.
  225" for a publication date of 14–29 January 1847, consistent with Muquardt's listing
  of the work in February 1847. Wagner discusses this part in his overview of works
  published during 1846, but Wagner's work was itself published during 1847 and he could
  plausibly have included a work published very early in 1847.
- When were the terrestrial mammal plates published? Evenhuis claims that all the plates
  of terrestrial mammals were only published in 1875, along with the corresponding text,
  while Rosove, who examined original wrappers for each of the relevant parts, places
  some of them with Part IV in 1844. In the work itself (p. 12d, 1875) Gray cites
  "Hapalotis Richardsonii, _Gray, Zool. Erebus and Terror, Mamm., pl. 28, fig. 2,
  ined._", claiming that the plate was not published (consistent with Rosove). Wagner's
  notice (discussed above) proves conclusively that plates M18–M22 and M25 had been
  published by 1847.

There is also some disagreement about a few of the other plates; I have not researched
those further.

### Treatment in the database

It is evident from the above discussion that Rosove's bibliography is generally more
consistent with the evidence. Therefore, I accept Rosove's assignment of the text and
plates to parts in its entirety. However, I agree with Evenhuis that parts XIII–XV were
likely published in January 1847, not in 1846.

I cite the work as follows:

- {Aves, Mammalia-Erebus & Terror voyage.pdf} for the entirety of the mammals and birds
  portion of the work.
  - {Mammalia-Erebus & Terror 1 (Gray 1844)} (by June 1, 1844) for Part I, containing
    pp. 1–4, ppl. M3–M10, M14, M16 (seals)
  - {Mammalia-Erebus & Terror 4 (Gray 1844)} (by December 2, 1844) for Part IV,
    containing pp. 5–8, ppl. M1, M2, M15, M17, M18–M22, M25 (text on seals; plates on
    seals and terrestrial mammals)
  - {Cetacea (Gray 1846).pdf} (by January 29, 1847) for Parts XIII–XV, containing pp.
    13–53, ppl. C1–C30 (whales)
  - {Mammalia-Erebus & Terror 23 (Gray 1875)} (by May 1875) for Part XXIII, containing
    pp. 9–12, 12a–12d, ppl. M26–M29, C31–C37 (text on seals and terrestrial mammals;
    plates on terrestrial mammals and whales)
