# Griffith's _General and Particular Descriptions_

Edward Griffith published his _General and Particular Descriptions of the Vertebrated
Animals_ around 1821. The preface to the first volume lays out an extensive plan
covering all vertebrates as well as a general introduction to zoology, but only two
volumes were ever published: Quadrumana (i.e., primates) and Carnivora. These are often
referred to as parts 1 and 2, though these numbers do not appear in the works
themselves.

## Internal evidence

The primate volume bears the cover date of 1821. I have not found other clues within the
work that constrain its date.

The carnivore volume also bears the cover date of 1821. On p. 292, the account of
_Tupaia Javanica_ mentions that "Dr. Horsfield has lately given a more detailed
description of them, accompanied with excellent engravings, in his work now publishing
on the animals of Java and the neighbouring islands". Horsfield's plate of _Tupaia
javanica_ was published in April 1822 in Part III of this _Zoological Researches_ (see
{Aves, Mammalia Java-Horsfield dates (Reitmeyer & Dickinson 2019).pdf}). It also refers
to {Sumatra (Raffles 1821).pdf}, which was published sometime in 1821.

  listing the books in the Society's library, mentions parts 1 and 2 with the dates
  "1821-22".

  writes that the first part (Quadrumana) is complete, and that "The Second Part will
  contain the Order Carnivora: Of this the First Number is published." This appears to
  be a publisher's catalogue attached to the February 1822 issue.

    lists only part 1.
- Secondary sources
  - {Library-BMNH catalog 2.pdf} p. 735 lists only the Quadrumana volume, cited as 1821.
  - {Animalia-index (A-Aff).pdf} p. lxiii mentions both volumes, dated to 1821.

## Conclusion

The primary source evidence is sparse, mostly consisting of brief notices. Nevertheless,
these notices establish that part 1 was indeed published in 1821, but publication of
part 2 only started in early 1822. Both volumes were likely published in numbers over
the course of some months, but there is no evidence to establish their exact number or
contents. It is not clear when part 2 was completed, but it was likely by the end
of 1822.

Thus, I treat the two volumes as follows:

- Part 1, 1821: {Primates (Griffith 1821.pdf)}
- Part 2, 1822: {Carnivora (Griffith 1821.pdf)}

## Nomenclature

The _General and Particular Description_ is significant to mammal nomenclature as the
first publication of a number of available names, including those of the species
_Trachypithecus mauritius_ (part 1, p. 58) and _Neofelis nebulosa_ (part 2, p. 37). The
first description of _Paguma larvata_ also appears in part 2, p. 263, though this name
is usually attributed to a later work by Griffith.

The work appears to use binomial nomenclature on a first look: species are cited with a
genus and species name. However, Griffith's use of genera is inconsistent. He divides
each order into informal "sections", and uses generic names in a way that is not
consistent with these sections. For example, the section on hyenas (part 2, p. 97)
states in the text that the hyenas have been formed into a genus separate from the dogs,
but then two species are listed as _Canis hyaena_ (p. 103) and _Canis crocuta_ (p. 107),
followed by _Hyaena picta_ (p. 109) and three other species in the genus _Hyaena_. A
later section on dogs (p. 185) lists additional species assigned to _Canis_. Similar
examples may be found throughout both volumes; for instance, monkeys assigned to various
sections are all listed in the genus _Simia_, except a few howlers in _Stentor_ and the
chimpanzee in _Homo_.

Despite this inconsistency, I accept both volumes as available for purposes of
nomenclature.
