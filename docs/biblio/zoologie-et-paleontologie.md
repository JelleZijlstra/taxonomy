# Zoologie et Paléontologie Françaises

Gervais published his _Zoologie et paléontologie françaises_ from 1848 to 1852. The work
is difficult because it lacks a continuous pagination and was published over several
years. I am not aware of any published work summarizing the publication history of the
book.

## The work

The title of the work runs "Zoologie / et / paléontologie françaises / (animaux
vertébrés) / ou / nouvelles recherches / sur / les animaux vivants et fossiles de la
France / par M. Paul Gervais".

It consists of three _tomes_, each with a separate title page that repeats the title of
the full work and the dates 1848–1852:

- "Tome I. / Contenant l'énumération méthodique et descriptive des espèces / ainsi que
  les principles de leur distribution géographique et paléontologique." Consists of
  viii + 271 continuously numbered pages.
  - The "Avertissement" starting on p. i lays out the work. Tome I has most of the text.
    Tome II consists of explanations for plates, plus some additional material that came
    up after the corresponding text in Tome I was published. Amphibians and fish are
    covered only in Tome II.
  - p. 263 cites a paper published in the _Annals and Magazine_ in August 1852.
- "Tome II. / Contenant l'explication des planches et divers mémoires / relatifs aux
  animaux vertébrés." Consists of discontinuous text associated with plate numbers.
  Sometimes multiple plates are covered in the same section.

In my library I have several partial copies of the work:

- {France (Gervais 1852).pdf}
  - Tome I and II. This is used as the main reference.
- {France (Gervais 1852) (1).pdf}
  - Only Tome I
- {France (Gervais 1852) (2).pdf}
  - Only Tome II
- {France (Gervais 1852) (plates).pdf}
  - Only Tome III

A second edition was published in 1859, apparently in a single part.
[Notice #5743](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.319510019169955&view=1up&seq=308&q1=gervais)
in the _Bibliographie de la France_ for 25 June 1859 (48e année, 2e série, no. 26)
establishes its date of publication. Although both editions were influential, the second
was perhaps more widely read; it is not uncommon for names that already appeared in the
first edition to be cited to the second.

## Bibliographic sources

The work itself contains some evidence to constrain its dates. On p. 244, there is a
reference to "Test. Larteti, Pictet, Paléont., t. I, p. 444." This refers to {Animalia
fossil (Pictet 1853.pdf)}, a work that bears a cover date of 1853 and has a preface
dated 20 December 1852 (p. ix). Pictet's book may have been published in parts, but
there is no concrete evidence for this, and it totals 580 pages, so most of it must have
been available by the time Gervais wrote his work. The first reference to the second
edition of Pictet's work (the first appeared in 1844) is on p. 200 of Gervais's book.

I found the following external evidence:

- _Archives des sciences physiques et naturelles_ (Geneva journal that frequently
  published summaries of recent French literature)
  - {France-Gervais livr 1 (Geneva).pdf}
    - Discusses livraison 1, which is said to consist of plates 3–5 and 10 with their
      explanations. It was published in 1848. The discussion of the contents of the
      plates matches that in the work itself, but it is interesting that pl. 6 (which is
      discussed together with 4 and 5 in Tome II) is not mentioned.
  - {France-Gervais livr 2 (Geneva).pdf}
  - {France-Gervais livr 2 again (Geneva).pdf}
    - These both discuss livraison 2. The first notice appeared in January 1849, but it
      gives no date for when the livraison appeared. Livraison 2 contained plates 2, 8,
      11, and 12. The second notice discusses pl. 11 in more detail. The notice says
      that plates 2 and 11 are accompanied by a detailed discussion, perhaps suggesting
      that the equally detailed discussion that accompanies pl. 12 in the finished work
      was not in this livraison.
  - I have not found any further notices in the _Archives_, but I have not checked all
    volumes (they are a little difficult to locate in Google Books; I did check volumes
    11–13, 15, and 16).
- _Bibliographie de la France_ (notices of books newly published in France)

    #6874 on p. 606 of year 39, no. 47, published 23 November 1850.
    - 8 livraisons published so far with 32 plates; 20 total livraisons expected.
  - I searched through the 1848–1853 volumes but found no other mention of Gervais's
    work.
- _Archiv für Naturgeschichte_ (German journal, where every year Wagner published a
  summary of the previous year's mammalogical work)
  - [vol. 15, p. 3](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/13706022) (data for 1848)
    - 2 livraisons were published but Wagner has not seen them.
  - [vol. 16, p. 9](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6961092) (data for 1849)
    - Still only 2 livraisons. Later in the article (pp. 11, 25, 30, 32, 36, 38, 40,
      42), Wagner cites pls. 1, 3, 4-6, 7, 8, and 9. That is more plates than appeared
      in the first two livraisons according to the Geneva notices.
  - [vol. 17, p. 6](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/6956581) (data for 1850)
    - Another 6 livraisons appeared. They contain text for all non-marine French
      mammals. There are page references to pp. 5, 29, 120, 125, 132 of Tome I.
  - [vol. 19, p. 5](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/7071476) (data for 1852)
    - The work reached livraison 14, but Wagner does not discuss what was in those
      livraisons.
  - vols. 18 and 20 contain no discussion of Gervais's work.

    - Livraisons 1–8, with pp. 1–136, 32 plates, 64 pages of explanation. (Note that
      pls. 1–30 collectively have 64 pp. of text in Tome II.)
    - This catalog is for January–June 1851.

    - Livraisons 9–20, completing the work. Each livraisons contains 4 plates and 2 1/2
      leaves of text.
    - This catalog is for July–December 1852.
- Scattered references
  - [_Revue et magasin de zoologie_, ser. 2, vol. 3, p. 195](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Revue_et_magasin_de_zoologie_pure_et_app/V2tIAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA195&printsec=frontcover&dq=gervais%20zoologie)

    - Proceedings of a 7 April 1851 session of the Académie

    - p. 11 cites pl. 39 of the _Zoologie et Paléontologie_
- Sherborn's _Index Animalium_
  - {Animalia-index (A-Aff).pdf}
    - p. lviii reads "Zool. et Paléont. Franç. 4to. Paris, 1848–. [Pp. 1–144 and
      descr. to 21 pls. were issued by 23 Nov. 1850 and are here quoted.]"

Thus, there were 20 livraisons of 4 plates each. The plates did not necessarily appear
in order.

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, the evidence is insufficient to reconstruct the publication history of
the work in full. Only the following is known securely:

- Livr. 1 contained pls. 3, 4, 5, and 10 and was published in 1848.
- Livr. 2 contained pls. 2, 8, 11, and 12 and was published by January 1849.
- Plates 1, 6, 7, and 9 were published in 1849.
- Livr. 3–8 were published by 23 November 1850. They contained Tome I, pp. 1–136, and
  probably 24 additional plates.
- Livr. 9–20 were published by 1852 according to the _Bibliotheca historico-naturalis_,
  but the internal evidence from citations to Pictet indicates that much of this part of
  the book did not appear until 1853.
- Plate 39 was published by April 1851.

If a copy with original wrappers could be found, it could provide a more precise
collation.

In the database I use the following citations:

- {France (Gervais 1848) (livr 1)} for livraison 1
- {France (Gervais 1849) (livr 2)} for livraison 2
- {France (Gervais 1850) (livr 1-8)} for Tome I, pp. 1–136, which contains numerous new
  mammal names.
- {France (Gervais 1852) (livr 9-20)} for the rest, even if much of it may have been
  published earlier.
