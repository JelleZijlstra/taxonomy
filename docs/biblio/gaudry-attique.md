# Gaudry's _Animaux fossiles et géologie de l'Attique_

This book, which concerns the fossil mammals of Pikermi, Greece, has a relatively
straightforward history, but since it was published in parts and the division is not
completely obvious, I record my findings here.

My copy comes from Gallica (the website of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France). It has
474 numbered pages, followed by a note entitled "Dates de la publication des diverses
livraisons qui composent cet ouvrage". It records the publication of the _livraisons_,
_feuilles_ (leaves), and _planches_ (plates) of the work, as follows:

- 1862: livr. 1–3, f. 1–9, pl. 1–12
- 1863: livr. 4–6, f. 10–18, pl. 13–24
- 1864: livr. 7–10, f. 19–30, pl. 25–40
- 1865: livr. 11–13, f. 31–41, pl. 41–52
- 1866: livr. 14–15, f. 42–47, pl. 53–60
- 1867: livr. 16–19, f. 48–60, pl. 61–75

Thus, the work was published in 19 parts over a six-year period. Most parts contained
three leaves, but some 1865 and 1867 parts contained more.

In the text, there are markings on many pages, as follows:

- p. 73: "10 – 1863"
- p. 81: "11 – 1863"
- p. 89: "12 – 1863"
- p. 97: "13 – 1863"
- p. 105: "14 - 1863"
- p. 113: "15 – 1863"
- p. 121: "16 – 1863" (but seems to bear a stamp "1864" from the Bibliothèque Impériale)
- p. 129: "17 – 1863"
- p. 137: "18 – 1863"
- p. 145: "19 – 1864"

The first part of the book (presumably published in 1862) lacks these markings. I have
not looked for them consistently through the last parts of the book.

These markings are consistent with the following hypothesis:

- Each marking is at the beginning of the leaf
- Each leaf is exactly 8 pages

This implies the following publication dates:

- 1862: pp. 1–72
- 1863: pp. 73–144
- 1864: pp. 145–240
- 1865: pp. 241–328
- 1866: pp. 329–376
- 1867: pp. 377–474
