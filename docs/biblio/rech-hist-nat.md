# _Recherches pour servir à l'histoire naturelle des mammifères_

This book was published from 1868 to 1874 by Henri Milne-Edwards (1800–1885) and his son
Alphonse Milne-Edwards (1835–1900). It is of interest mostly for descriptions of a
number of new taxa from China.

### Contents

The work consists of two volumes:

- _Tome premier – Texte_ has 394 pages of continuous text, including an index and table
  of contents at the end. It is divided into four parts, preceded by a preface by Henri:
  - _Considérations sur les affinités naturelles et la classification méthodique des
    Mammifères_ by Henri, pp. 6–42
  - _Observations sur l'Hippopotame de Liberia_ by Alphonse, pp. 43–66
  - _Études pour servir à l'histoire de la Faune mammalogique de la Chine_ by Alphonse,
    pp. 67–230
  - _Mémoire sur la Faune mammalogique du Tibet oriental, et principalement de la
    principauté de Moupin_ by Alphonse, pp. 231-386
- _Tome second – Atlas_ contains plates, 105 in total according to the title page. A
  list at the beginning of the volume lists plates 1 through 81 plus a number of
  out-of-sequence numbers (e.g., 31A).

The title pages of both volumes bear the date "1868 à 1874".

### Discussion

The evidence gathered so far provides enough data for a general account of the history
of publication of the work, but not enough to assign all the plates and give exact dates
of publication. A few observations:

- The publication of the work was obviously affected by the Franco-Prussian War of
  1870–71. It may be assumed that nothing was published between the beginning of the
  Siege of Paris (19 September 1870) and the end of the Paris Commune (28 May 1871).
- The _Zoological Record_ provides the only complete account of the publication of the
  work; in other sources I have found some notices, but they do not cover all
  livraisons.
- Plates were evidently published in a somewhat haphazard order, but there is little
  evidence for exact dates.

### Treatment in the database

We organize the work as follows:

- {Mammalia-study (Milne-Edwards 1868-74).pdf}
  - {Mammalia-considerations (Milne-Edwards 1868)} (probably by November 23)
  - {Choeropsis (Milne-Edwards 1868)}
  - {Mammalia China (Milne-Edwards 1868-72)}
    - {Mammalia China (Milne-Edwards 1869) (livr 4-5)} (pp. 67-128; pl. 32-33)
    - {Mammalia China (Milne-Edwards 1871) (livr 6-9)} (pp. 129-208)
    - {Mammalia China (Milne-Edwards 1872) (livr 10-15)} (pp. 209-230)
  - {Mammalia Sichuan (Milne-Edwards 1872-4)} (pp. 231-386)
    - {Mammalia Sichuan (Milne-Edwards 1872) (livr 10-15)} (pp. 231-304)
    - {Mammalia Sichuan (Milne-Edwards 1874) (livr 16-20)} (pp. 305-386)
