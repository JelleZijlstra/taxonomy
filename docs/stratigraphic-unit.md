# Stratigraphic units

Stratigraphic units are subdivisions of the rock record, such as
formations and members. Strictly speaking, these are 
lithostratigraphic units; some biostratigraphic units are listed as
[Periods](/docs/period) instead.

## Fields

Stratigraphic units have the following fields:

- _name_: The name of the stratigraphic unit.
- _rank_: The rank of the unit, such as _formation_.
- _parent_: The parent unit of this unit, such as [Morrison Formation](/s/Morrison_Formation) for the
  [Brushy Basin Member](/s/Brushy_Basin_Member).
- _prev_: The unit underlying this one.
- _min period_: The youngest period that this unit is correlated to. For example, the
  [Sarmiento Formation](/s/Sarmiento_Formation) contains fossils referable to the [Vacan](/p/Vacan) through [Pinturan](/p/Pinturan) South American Land Mammal Ages, so its min_period is the
  Pinturan.
- _max period_: The oldest period that this unit is correlated to.
- _region_: The [region](region) that this unit exists in.
- _comment_: Any comment on the unit, usually containing references to relevant literature.
