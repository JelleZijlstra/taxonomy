# Data sources

The database was compiled from many sources. My goal is to verify all data against
primary sources (e.g., original descriptions), but that is an enormous task that I am
only slowly making progress on. This page lists some major resources that I use to
collect data.

## Online libraries

Major online resources that host relevant literature include:

- [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/), an amazing
  resource that provides a huge amount of literature
- [Google Books](https://books.google.com/), which also provides access to numerous old
  books
- [Gallica](https://gallica.bnf.fr/), providing access to French literature
- [Zobodat](https://www.zobodat.at/), providing access to mostly Austrian and German
  literature
- And many journal-specific and publisher-specific sites

Thanks to U.S. copyright law, publications from 1923 and earlier are usually available
online, as they are no longer under copyright in the U.S. Later publications are
generally still under copyright, so they are available online only if the copyright
holder consents. Fortunately, many journals relevant to animal nomenclature have been
made available online.

## Reference works

There are several published reference works that have been invaluable for developing the
database. These include:

- [Wilson & Reeder (2005)](/a/9291): citations and type localities for extant mammals;
  names and authorities of synonyms
- [McKenna & Bell (1997)](/a/9784): names and synonyms for mammals at the genus level
  and above; page numbers but no full citations
- [Rhodin et al. (2021)](/a/57132): names, synonyms, type localities, type specimens,
  and references for extant turtles

There is a series of books, published mostly around the 1940s and 1950s, that together
provide original references, original names, and type localities for the vast majority
of extant mammal names. These include:

- [Miller & Kellogg (1955)](/a/5718): North America
- [Cabrera (1958)](/a/36476) and [Cabrera (1961)](/a/37366): South America, but does not
  provide type localities for synonyms
- _Mammals of South America_: an up-to-date, very detailed account of South American
  mammals
  - [Gardner (2008)](/a/5818): marsupials, xenarthrans, shrews, bats
  - [Patton et al. (2015)](/a/27628): rodents
  - I am eagerly awaiting further volumes
- [Ellerman & Morrison-Scott (1966)](/a/8465): most of Eurasia
- [Chasen (1940)](/a/5889): Sunda region
- [Laurie & Hill (1954)](/a/31868): New Guinea and Sulawesi
- [Jackson & Groves (2015)](/a/34474): Australia
- [Allen (1939)](/a/5450): Africa
- [Meester et al. (1986)](/a/17614): southern Africa

The most recent works (Gardner, 2008; Patton et al., 2015; Jackson & Groves, 2015) stand
out because they provide far more detailed nomenclatural information.

Taken together, these references cover most of the world, with the exception of the
Philippines, most of the Oceanian islands, and Antarctica. Of course, they also do not
cover names introduced after the reference was published. I try to fill in these gaps
with more scattered references, including original descriptions and smaller-scale
taxonomic reviews.
