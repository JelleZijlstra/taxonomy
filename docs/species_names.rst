Species names
*************

This page describes the formation of species-group names.

Under Article 11.9.1, species names fall in one of five groups: (1) Latin adjectives, (2) Latin nouns
in the nominative case, (3) Latin or Latinized nouns in the genitive case, (4) Latin adjectives in the
genitive case, and (5) non-Latin words. Understanding these categories is primarily useful for
determining whether and how species names need to be declined for gender. It also makes it easier to
understand the etymologies of names.

Latin adjectives
----------------
Latin and Latinized adjectives are a very common category of species names. Names in this group are
the only ones that change form depending on the grammatical gender of the genus they are assigned to.
Zoological nomenclature declines only Latin and Latinized adjectives; adjectives in other languages,
even Greek, are treated as indeclinable (Art. 31.2.3).

There are two main groups of Latin adjectives, and several smaller ones:
- First and second declension adjectives in -us, -a, -um (for example, rufus "red").
- Third declension adjectives in -is, -is, -e (for example, agilis "agile"). This includes names in
  -ensis, which are commonly used with geographic names. These adjectives are identical in the masculine
  and feminine forms, but the neuter form uses the -e ending.
- Third declension adjectives in -ns, which are identical in all genders in the nominative singular and
  can therefore be treated as indeclinable for the purposes of nomenclature. This includes names like
  elegans "elegant" and rufescens "reddish".
- First and second declension adjectives in -(e)r, -ra, -rum (for example, ater "black"). These are
  fairly rare, but a few names in this category are common.
- Third declension adjectives in -or, -or, -us. These are frequently comparatives, including major
  "larger" and minor "smaller".

Latin has many other groups of irregular adjectives, including some that are used in scientific names,
such as alius, alia, aliud and celer, celeris, celere.

There is a special group of names of the form adjective-i-noun, where the noun is often a body part,
like breviceps "short-headed". I believe that these names are adjectives, although many are
indeclinable.

Nouns in apposition
-------------------
Latin nouns in the nominative case are fairly common as scientific names. For example, typus "type"
is common. The Code specifies (Art. 31.2.2) that names that could be either a noun or an
adjective are to be treated as nouns unless there is evidence that the author intended them to be
adjectives. This affects many names in -fer.

Genitive nouns
--------------
Latin nouns in the genitive case are often geographic names (e.g. italiae "of Italy"). However, by
far the most common group are patronyms, names formed from personal names. Patronyms in turn fall
into two subgroups. Latin and Latinized names use the proper Latin genitive form, which will
frequently be a suffix of -is or -i. Modern names are turned into patronyms by adding -i (for a man),
-ae (for a woman), -orum (for multiple men or a mixed group), or -arum (for women).

A few practical issues that arise are:
- Taxonomists regularly make mistakes with patronymic endings, like using -i when naming a species
  after a group of people or using -i for a woman's name. However, such errors may not be corrected
  by changing the name (see Art. 31.1.3 and 32.5).
- There is frequently variation between names in -ii and -i. The latter is the standard non-Latin
  patronymic ending, and the former is the result of implicitly Latinizing a name by adding the
  ending -ius, then taking the genitive. In general, the original spelling should be followed.
  The Code has special prohibitions that stipulate that variation between -i and -ii is always
  an incorrect subsequent spelling, not an emendation, and that -i and -ii names are homonyms
  even if spelled differently (Art. 58).

Genitive adjectives
-------------------
Although the Code allows for species names formed from the genitive forms of Latin adjectives,
the provision appears to be mostly intended for parasites. I have never encountered such names
in tetrapods.

Non-Latin words
---------------
A large proportion of species names are not based on Latin or Latinized words. These names are
always indeclinable.
