# Collection databases

Type specimen data is an important aspect of this database. For the most part, type
specimens have been assembled from the primary literature (e.g., new species
descriptions and revisions) and from published type catalogs. However, most museums now
have online searchable collection databases that mention type status. The quality of
type data is often not as high as in published type catalogs or revisionary studies, but
these databases can still provide valuable data:

- Verify details in the original descriptions and catch typographical errors
- Fill in gaps in the data, such as missing type specimens
- Allow cross-links to the museum website, which may include images of the type specimen
  or other useful data

On this page I list online collection databases that I have run full cross-checks
against.

## MCZ (August 2023)

[MCZ-types]

Covered:

- [Extant mammals](</c/MCZ_(Mammalogy)>): 328 types

* [Fossil vertebrates](</c/MCZ_(Vertebrate_Paleontology)>): 151 types

Generally high-quality data; only a few discrepancies identified.

## BMNH (August 2023)

[BMNH-catalog]

Covered:

- [Extant mammals](</c/BMNH_(mammals)>): 5760 types

The BMNH hosts type specimens for about 20% of all named extant mammals, the most of any
collection. The catalog contains a wealth of information, but it is incomplete and there
are many mistakes. For example, the holotype of [_Murexia longicaudata parva_](/n/4615)
appears in the database twice, once with the correct number of 1950.1114 and once with
an incorrect number of 1950.114. About 2000 type specimens are in the database, but are
not marked as types. I was able to connect over 5000 entries in my database to entries
in the collection database, but about 400 specimens are left that appear to be missing
from the online database.

Type specimens from several other collections were eventually moved to the BMNH. I
searched the BMNH catalog for all specimens listed as part of the
[Kloss collection](/c/CBK), which apparently largely ended up in London. This is likely
also true for much of [FMSM](/c/FMSM) and perhaps some additional specimens in
[RM](c/ZRC).

## CAS (August 2023)

[CAS-catalog]

Covered:

- [Extant mammals](</c/CAS_(Ornithology_&_Mammalogy)>) (22 types)
- [Reptiles and amphibians](</c/CAS_(Herpetology)>) (17 types)

The California Academy of Sciences has a relatively small mammal collection, but is more
prominent among the herps. The online type catalog is good, but doesn't always make
clear _what name_ a specimen is the type of. This collection absorbed the previous
Stanford collection.

I skipped the fossil collection because the online database isn't as usable.

## QM (August 2023)

[QM-catalog]

Covered:

- [QM](/c/QM) (part; 296 types in my database)

The Queensland Museum is one of the few major Australian collections without a published
mammalian type catalog. The online database is helpful and well-illustrated, but sparse
on precise data. For example,
[QM JM8061](https://collections.qm.qld.gov.au/objects/VE110266/thylogale-stigmatica) is
identified as _Thylogale stigmatica_ and listed as a holotype. It cannot be the holotype
of _stigmatica_; it may be the holotype of some synonym described by De Vis, but the
QM's database gives few clues to figure that out. I did not do a thorough check, but
some holotypes appear to be missing.

## MNHN (August 2023)

[MNHN-catalog]

Currently 1294 types, including many fossils.

The online database warns that it is incomplete, but it lists exactly 1000 type
specimens.

The MNHN collection has had a bewildering variety of numbering schemes. The online
database now uses several prefixes, most commonly "MO" but also sometimes "AC" or no
prefix. I assume "MO" is the main mammal collection and "AC is "Anatomie Comparée", the
old comparative anatomy collection.

I have seen at least the following in the literature:

- Numbers prefixed with "CG" or "Collection Générale" plus a year and a number. I assume
  this corresponds to the MO numbers.
- Musée de l'Anatomie Comparée numbers, prefixed with "AC".
- "Galérie" numbers, presumably associated with a catalog in the public "gallery"
  collection. There are at least two different such catalogs, an old and a new one.
- "Type" numbers, associated with some catalog of type specimens. Such numbers should be
  given as "MNHN type 123".
- Numbers listed without indication of what catalog they refer to, e.g. "MNHN 722".
  These should be changed to "MNHN ? 722" to indicate that it is unclear what they refer
  to.
