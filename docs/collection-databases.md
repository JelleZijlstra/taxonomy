# Collection databases

Type specimen data is an important aspect of this database. For the most part, type
specimens have been assembled from the primary literature (e.g., new species
descriptions and revisions) and from published type catalogs. However, most museums now
have online searchable collection databases that mention type status. The quality of
type data is often not as high as in published type catalogs or revisionary studies, but
these databases can still provide valuable data:

- Verify details in the original descriptions and catch typographical errors
- Fill in gaps in the data, such as missing type specimens
- Allow cross-links to the museum website, which may include images of the type specimen
  or other useful data

On this page I list online collection databases that I have run full cross-checks
against.

## MCZ (August 2023)

[MCZ-types]

Covered:

- [Extant mammals](</c/MCZ_(Mammalogy)>): 328 types
- [Fossil vertebrates](</c/MCZ_(Vertebrate_Paleontology)>): 151 types

Generally high-quality data; only a few discrepancies identified.

## BMNH (August 2023)

[BMNH-catalog]

Covered:

- [Extant mammals](</c/BMNH_(mammals)>): 5760 types

The BMNH hosts type specimens for about 20% of all named extant mammals, the most of any
collection. The catalog contains a wealth of information, but it is incomplete and there
are many mistakes. For example, the holotype of [_Murexia longicaudata parva_](/n/4615)
appears in the database twice, once with the correct number of 1950.1114 and once with
an incorrect number of 1950.114. About 2000 type specimens are in the database, but are
not marked as types. I was able to connect over 5000 entries in my database to entries
in the collection database, but about 400 specimens are left that appear to be missing
from the online database.

Type specimens from several other collections were eventually moved to the BMNH. I
searched the BMNH catalog for all specimens listed as part of the
[Kloss collection](/c/CBK), which apparently largely ended up in London. This is likely
also true for much of [FMSM](/c/FMSM) and perhaps some additional specimens in
[RM](c/ZRC).

Switching back to a single collection:

- "BMNH Reptiles 1901.2.3.4"
- "BMNH Mammals 1901.2.3.4"
- "BMNH Mammals 123a"
- "BMNH Amphibians 1901.2.3.4"
- "BMNH Minor phyla 1901.2.3.4"
- "BMNH PV R 1234"
- "BMNH PV M 1234"
- "BMNH PV A 1234"
- "BMNH PV OR 1234"
- "BMNH PV In 1234"

## CAS (August 2023)

[CAS-catalog]

Covered:

- [Extant mammals](</c/CAS_(Ornithology_&_Mammalogy)>) (22 types)
- [Reptiles and amphibians](</c/CAS_(Herpetology)>) (17 types)

The California Academy of Sciences has a relatively small mammal collection, but is more
prominent among the herps. The online type catalog is good, but doesn't always make
clear _what name_ a specimen is the type of. This collection absorbed the previous
Stanford collection.

I skipped the fossil collection because the online database isn't as usable.

## QM (August 2023)

[QM-catalog]

Covered:

- [QM](/c/QM) (part; 296 types in my database)

The Queensland Museum is one of the few major Australian collections without a published
mammalian type catalog. The online database is helpful and well-illustrated, but sparse
on precise data. For example,
[QM JM8061](https://collections.qm.qld.gov.au/objects/VE110266/thylogale-stigmatica) is
identified as _Thylogale stigmatica_ and listed as a holotype. It cannot be the holotype
of _stigmatica_; it may be the holotype of some synonym described by De Vis, but the
QM's database gives few clues to figure that out. I did not do a thorough check, but
some holotypes appear to be missing.

## MNHN (August 2023)

[MNHN-catalog]

Currently 1294 types, including many fossils.

The online database warns that it is incomplete, but it lists exactly 1000 type
specimens.

The MNHN collection has had a bewildering variety of numbering schemes. The online
database now uses several prefixes, most commonly "MO" but also sometimes "AC" or no
prefix. I assume "MO" is the main mammal collection and "AC is "Anatomie Comparée", the
old comparative anatomy collection.

I have seen at least the following in the literature:

- Numbers prefixed with "CG" or "Collection Générale" plus a year and a number. I assume
  this corresponds to the MO numbers.
- Musée de l'Anatomie Comparée numbers, prefixed with "AC".
- "Galérie" numbers, presumably associated with a catalog in the public "gallery"
  collection. There are at least two different such catalogs, an old and a new one.
- "Type" numbers, associated with some catalog of type specimens. Such numbers should be
  given as "MNHN type 123".
- Numbers listed without indication of what catalog they refer to, e.g. "MNHN 722".
  These should be changed to "MNHN ? 722" to indicate that it is unclear what they refer
  to.

As the website warned, the catalog is incomplete, and many type specimens are missing.

## RMNH (August 2023)

[RMNH-catalog]

Number of types: 471 extant mammals; 23 amphibians and reptiles in my database; 83
fossils.

This is a high-quality database. Different components of a single specimen (e.g., skin
and skull) are consistently listed as separate database entries. Type specimens of
synonyms are mostly not marked as types. A few type specimens mentioned in the
literature are missing from the database.

## SMF (August 2023)

[SMF-catalog]

About 286 types, including 200 extant mammals.

The database is fairly thorough but does not allow links to particular specimen pages
and does not allow downloading data in spreadsheet format, making it difficult to work
with. Some types of synonyms are not marked as types in the relevant column.

I moved extant mammal types to the "SMF (Mammalogie)" subcollection but left other taxa
for later.

## YPM (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

Started going over VertNet mammal type specimens. This resource provides data from a
variety of collections, mostly in the US.

The YPM has over 800 fossil vertebrate type specimens, principally fossil mammals. It
absorbed the former Princeton collection.

The type catalog appears to be of fairly high quality. Many specimens are spuriously
marked as types.

## AMNH (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

Only extant taxa are covered in VertNet. A separate database for the fossils is
[online](https://www.amnh.org/research/paleontology/collections/database) but said to be
incomplete.

3266 type specimens currently in the database, including 1734 fossil mammals, 1131
extant mammals, and 292 fossil reptiles.

Citation form to use:

- Extant mammals: AMNH M-12345
- Extant mammals (osteology collection): AMNH MO-12345
- Extant mammals (skin collection): AMNH MS-12345
- Extant reptiles: AMNH R-12345
- Extant amphibians: AMNH A-12345
- Frick collection: F:AM 12345 (or F:B:AM)
- Fossil mammals: AMNH FM-12345
- Fossil herps and birds: AMNH FARB-12345
- Fossil fishes: AMNH FF-12345
- Invertebrate collections: AMNH Gnathostomula-12345, AMNH Platyhelminths-12345

The type specimen coverage is fairly good, but most (all?) types added since the 1990s
are not marked as types. For types of synonyms, the name for which the specimen is the
type is not clearly recorded.

## BPBM (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

Only 28 type specimens. A few recently designated ones are not marked as types in the
database. Conversely, a specimen of _Paraleptomys_ is marked as a holotype, apparently
of a species that was never published.

## DMNS (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

74 types, but only a dozen or so extant mammals. Some types are not marked as such in
VertNet, though they all had correct annotations in Arctos. The fossil types aren't in
VertNet and I didn't bother to look for them elsewhere.

## FMNH (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

711 types. The VertNet data only goes to 2000 or so, and types added since then are not
included. However, the FMNH's own collection database does include more recent
specimens. I didn't attempt to download data from that database, but did add links for
specimens that aren't in VertNet.

Mammal specimens use "FMNH Mammals 12345", herps use "FMNH Amphibians and Reptiles
12345" (ugly but it's what VertNet shows). Fossil mammals are usually cited as "FMNH
P12345" and reptiles as "FMNH PR12345", so that's what I followed. There are also some
numbers like "FMNH UC 12345", which I assume refer to collections that were consolidated
into FMNH. For the fossils, there is no online collection database.

I enforced a consistent format for all type specimen numbers and added links to all
extant mammal types.

Notes:

- For _Sus cebifrons negrinus_, the holotype is incorrect
- Similar situation for _Thalpomys cerradensis_
- FMNH 53956 is said to _Calomys callosus callosus_, but I don't know what name it could
  be the holotype of.
- FMNH 49790 is not the neotype of _Myotis chiloensis_

## KU (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

335 types, more fossil than extant. VertNet data includes fossils. Some of the supposed
types appear to be for unpublished names. 28 type specimens were not marked as types in
the database but were present; 2 were missing from the database. I added type specimen
links for all specimens (except the two I couldn't find).

## LACM (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

253 types, mostly fossils. Includes the former CIT collection.

VertNet includes only extant types.

The fossil catalog is
[searchable](https://collections.nhm.org/vertebrate-paleontology/). Specimens are
numbered simply "LACM 12345" without a specimen number. I use "VP". In addition to the
vertebrate paleontology department, there is apparently a separate "Dinosaur Institute"
with [its own numbers](https://collections.nhm.org/dinosaur-institute/). Rancho La Brea
specimens are also cataloged separately in various systems. Extant taxa are recorded in
VertNet but not on the Museum's own website.

The LACM certainly absorbed the CIT's fossil collection (at least 143 types). However,
the extant mammals (about a dozen types, named by Burt in the 1930s) appears to be at
UCLA instead.

Numbering systems used:

- "LACM VP 12345" for fossils in the LACM catalog
- "CIT VP 12345" for fossils in the CIT catalog
- "LACM Mammals 12345" for extant mammals
- "LACM Herps 12345" for extant herps
- "LACM DI 12345" for the Dinosaur Insitute

Distribution of numbering systems:

- LACM VP: 146
- CIT VP: 143
- LACM Mammals: 26
- other: 9
- LACM Herps: 3
- LACM DI: 2

I only attempted to add type specimen links for the extant mammals.

## UCLA (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

Only one mammalian type was mentioned as being at UCLA in the original description, but
this collection absorbed the private collection of Donald R. Dickey and that of CIT,
making for a total of 51 mammalian types. The Dickey specimens were preserved under
their original numbers, while those from CIT were renumbered.

The holotype of _Thomomys umbrinus quercinus_, UCLA Mammals 20586 (= CIT 51176), is
marked as a "topotype" instead. All of its data match the holotype of _quercinus_. This
is also true for the types of _Perognathus spinatus latijugularis_, _Lepus californicus
sheldoni_, _Mustela erminea bangsi_, and _Thomomys burti_.

I added links to all specimens, except for one paleontological type (a fish); the
paleontological collection is not in VertNet.

## LSUMZ (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

32 types, including 26 mammals.

The types of _Artibeus aztecus major_, _Daptomys peruviensis_, _Myotis oxyotus
gardneri_, _Sciurus variegatoides loweryi_, _Vampyrops nigellus_ are not marked as
types.

Several herpetological types with high numbers (over 100,000) are not in VertNet at all.
Presumably VertNet reflects the data as it stood a few years ago.

## MBML (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

3 types, only one of which is marked correctly in the database. I found probable matches
for the other two.

## MSB (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

About 20 types, also in Arctos.

MSB 249345 is incorrectly marked as a syntype of _Ursus americanus_.

## NMR (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

Only 9 types, all present in VertNet. No issues, except that the type of _Tranatocetus
maregermanicum_ is not marked correctly.

## OMNH (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

Only two extant mammal types, one of which does not show up in VertNet. About 70 fossil
types, which are not in VertNet. The institution has an
[online catalog](http://snomnhcollections.azurewebsites.net/VertebratePaleontology) but
it is difficult to use and does not record type status.

## ROM (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

75 types, mostly fossils, but fossils are not listed in VertNet. I found all extant type
specimens in VertNet, but many of the more recent ones were not marked as types.

There is an online collection database but it attempts to combine the cultural and
zoological collections, which doesn't work great. Many types are not marked correctly.

## SDNHM (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

117 types, including 86 extant mammals. Fossils are not in VertNet; there is an
[online collection database](https://www.sdnhm.org/science/paleontology/research/collection-database/)
but it doesn't appear to allow links to individual specimens. I added links to all
mammal and herp type specimens in my database.

## UCMP (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

464 types. The VertNet type list includes casts, of which there are hundreds, but the
data included in VertNet do not allow distinguishing casts from original specimens. The
database pages (e.g.,
[UCMP 86143](https://ucmpdb.berkeley.edu/cgi/ucmp_query2?spec_id=V86143&one=T)) do
include a note that the specimen is a cast, but this field is not included in any
downloadable dataset. There are definitely a number of UCMP types not in my database,
but have given up for now on extracting them automatically from this database.

I was able to find database links for all but a handful of specimens. In a few cases
where a specimen number had been incorrectly cited in the literature, the database
helpfully provided a pointer to the correct number.

## UF (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

227 types, mostly fossils. Few problems: a few types were not marked correctly, some
recent specimens are not in VertNet, several specimens had typos in their numbers in the
original descriptions.

## UMMZ (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

155 types (including some herps), but VertNet only lists 4. Others are in the database
but not marked as types. Skipping this collection for now.

## UMNH (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

72 types, about half of them extant mammals, half fossils, and a few herps. The fossils
are not in VertNet or Arctos and I didn't look elsewhere. The types were straightforward
except that a handful were not marked as types in VertNet (though they were in Arctos).

## UMZC (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

Only a handful of types, but a few interesting ones I wasn't aware of, such as two
syntypes of _Notoryctes typhlops_.

## UTEP (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

Only five types, one of which (_Notiosorex dalquesti_) was not marked correctly in
VertNet.

## USNM (August 2023)

[VertNet-catalog]

4120 type specimens, including over 3000 extant and over 500 fossil mammals. I was able
to match up all but 150 or so with VertNet entries automatically.

Issues encountered:

- Some older specimens have cited specimen numbers of the form "USNM 123/456".
  Apparently, here the first number is the skin number and the second is the skull,
  cited as e.g. "USNM A456" in VertNet and in the USNM's own online database. Usually
  only the first number has an entry, but occasionally (if the skull has been lost),
  there is an entry only for the A number.
- A number of specimens had typos in their specimen numbers in the Fisher and Ludwig
  catalogs, and one (_Galago sotikae_) had a completely wrong number cited (that for the
  holotype of _Nycticebus borneanus_).
- Several subfossil forms from the Caribbean were transferred from the mammal collection
  to the vertebrate paleontology collection at some point and received new numbers.
- The invertebrate zoology department appears to have three different catalogs without a
  clear indicator as to how the numbers should be distinguished: one for arthropods, one
  for mollusks, and one for everything else. For now, I refer to these as
  "USNM:ARTHRO:", "USNM:MOLL:", and "USNM:IZ:". There are apparently also other catalogs
  (for poriferans and cnidarians?), but they do not appear in my database.
- Some recent paleontological specimens are not in the online database.
- Found three cases where my database incorrectly had a UNSM specimen listed as USNM.
- Specimens that are not physically in the collection are not in the online database.
