Conventions that should be moved to a proper place:

- Some articles have dual pagination: one for the article itself, one for the volume of
  the journal. Use the pagination for the journal, not the separate.
- In organ descriptions, abbreviate. We'll perhaps want to make this even more formulaic
  in the future. Examples:
  - LP4 = left upper fourth premolar
  - LM1/2 = left upper first or second molar
  - LM1-2 = left upper first and second molar (in the source material different
    conventions sometimes appear)
  - Rc = right lower canine (no need for "c1" since there's only ever one)
  - Ri = right lower incisor for rodents (there's only one; it's technically di2)
  - Always use numbers written in digits ("3 ribs")
  - Vertebrae may be abbreviated with C = cervical, T = thoracic, L = lumbar, S =
    sacral, Ca = caudal
  - Foot bones may be abbreviated, e.g. Mc = metacarpal, Mt = metatarsal. Digits use
    Roman numerals.
- We use American English spelling. For the form of place names (e.g., endonym vs.
  exonym), generally use Wikipedia. We might move more towards endonyms though.
- Where there is only one major collection in a city and it does not have an established
  abbreviation, use the city name as the collection label (e.g., "Montpellier" for the
  Universit√© de Montpellier).
- Giving the type specimen as "MTA (no number given)" is inappropriate; just leave the
  type specimen field blank until we figure out the number. "MTA (unnumbered)" is
  appropriate if the sources explicitly say that the specimen is in the MTA but doesn't
  have a catalog number.
- We should perhaps require the ProbableRepository field in cases where there is a type
  specimen number but no collection.
