# The _Hesperomys_ Project

Welcome to the _Hesperomys_ Project! This is a database of the nomenclature and taxonomy
of fossil and extinct mammals and other animals. It contains information such as type
locality, age, and type specimens for tens of thousands of names.

It can serve as a resource for scientists to explore the nomenclature and taxonomic
history of a group and the dataset can be used to extract statistical data about the
history of biology.

Start exploring the taxonomy at [Eukaryota](/t/Eukaryota) (until I expand to bacteria
and archaea), the geography at [Earth](/r/Earth) (until extraterrestrial life is
discovered), or the chronology at [Phanerozoic](/p/Phanerozoic) (until I incorporate
Precambrian fossils into the database).
