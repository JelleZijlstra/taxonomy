# The _Hesperomys_ Project

Welcome to the _Hesperomys_ Project! This is a database of the nomenclature and taxonomy
of fossil and extinct mammals and other animals. It contains information such as type
locality, age, and type specimens for tens of thousands of names.

It can serve as a resource for scientists to explore the nomenclature and taxonomic history
of a group and the dataset can be used to extract statistical data about the history of
biology.

Start exploring the taxonomy at [Eukaryota](/t/Eukaryota) (until I expand to bacteria and archaea),
the geography at [Earth](/r/Earth)
(until extraterrestrial life is discovered), or the chronology at [Phanerozoic](/p/Phanerozoic)
(until I incorporate Precambrian fossils into the database).

# Size
