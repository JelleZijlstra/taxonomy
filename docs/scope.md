# Scope

The _Hesperomys_ database primarily covers mammals, but also various other groups of
(mostly fossil) tetrapods and a few minor invertebrate groups. It focuses on aspects of
nomenclature, such as type specimens, technical availability, and etymology, but also
covers taxonomy and chronology.

## Information included

The focus of the database is on nomenclature and taxonomy. For each taxonomic group
covered, the aim is to include every available or otherwise notable name, list all
important nomenclatural information (such as data about types and original
descriptions), and place all names in a consistent, up-to-date taxonomic scheme.

## Taxonomic groups covered

Major groups covered include:

- [Mammals](/t/Mammalia)
- [Probainognathia](/t/Probainognathia), a clade that includes mammals and their closest
  relatives
- [Crocodylomorpha](/t/Crocodylomorpha), a clade that includes extant crocodylians and
  their relatives
- [Saurischia](/t/Saurischia), a clade of dinosaurs that includes sauropods and
  theropods, as well as birds. Mesozoic birds are also covered comprehensively, but
  Cenozoic birds are not covered except for a few taxa here and there.
- [Pterosauria](/t/Pterosauria), a group of Mesozoic flying archosaurs
- [Ichthyosauromorpha](/t/Ichthyosauromorpha), a group of Mesozoic marine reptiles
- [Rhynchocephalia](/t/Rhynchocephalia), an ancient group of reptiles that includes the
  living tuatara ([_Sphenodon_](/t/Sphenodon))
- [Choristodera](/t/Choristodera), a group of extinct reptiles that survived into the
  Miocene
- [Gymnophiona](/t/Gymnophiona), the caecilians, one of the three orders of extant
  amphibians
- [Allocaudata](/t/Allocaudata), a group of extinct amphibians that survived into the
  Pliocene
- A variety of individual species and small clades of tetrapods, such as
  [Pachycephalosauridae](/t/Pachycephalosauridae) and
  [Weigeltisauridae](/t/Weigeltisauridae)
- [Cephalochordata](/t/Cephalochordata), the lancelets, marine invertebrates closely
  related to vertebrates
- [Gnathostomulida](/t/Gnathostomulida), a minor group of marine invertebrates
- [Loricifera](/t/Loricifera), another minor group of marine invertebrates

For each covered group, we also include:

- Any taxon that has once been included in the group, but is not currently included. For
  example, [_Gwawinapterus_](/t/Gwawinapterus) is currently identified as a fish, but it
  was originally described as a pterosaur, so it is included in the database
- Any name that is a senior homonym of a name in the group. For example, insects are not
  generally covered, but the beetle [_Xenostylus_](/t/Xenostylus) is in the database
  because its name is a senior homonym of a fossil marsupial, since renamed
  [_Xenostylos_](/t/Xenostylos).

These groups have fairly comprehensive coverage in terms of names and taxa, although
surely there are some missing names here and there. However, for almost all of them
(Loricifera is pretty much done), there is a lot of missing data for type specimens,
type localities, and citations.

## Future additions

I am currently focusing on improving coverage for groups that are already included, but
I do aim to work gradually towards more comprehensive coverage of tetrapods. I am
especially interested in groups that tend to co-occur in the fossil record with mammals
and other currently covered groups. I am less likely to work on groups that include
large numbers of extant taxa, such as squamates, anurans, and birds, because these are a
bigger investment and there are already some fairly comprehensive nomenclatural
databases (e.g., [Amphibians of the World](https://amphibiansoftheworld.amnh.org/) and
the [Reptile Database](http://www.reptile-database.org/)).

Likely additions include:

- Turtles, which are common as fossils and often co-occur with mammals. They are fairly
  diverse as living taxa, but not excessively so.
- Filling in the gaps among the archosaurs by adding ornithischian dinosaurs and a few
  basal groups, such as rauisuchians and phytosaurs. Many major archosaur clades are
  already covered, and adding the rest would make for more consistency.
