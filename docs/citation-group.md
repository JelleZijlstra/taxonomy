# Citation group

"Citation group" are an organizing tool used in the database to group
similar [articles](/docs/article). There are three kinds of citation groups:

- Journal articles are grouped in journals
- Books are grouped by city of publication
- Dissertations are grouped by their university

For [names](/docs/name) that lack precise citation data, we try to include
the citation group in which they were originally published. That way, if I
gain access to the archive of a journal like [_Palaeontographica_](/cg/Palaeontographica),
it is easy to find all the articles in the journal that contain data of interest.

## Fields

Citation groups have the following fields:

- _type_: Journal, book, dissertation, or alias
- _name_: Name of the journal, city of publication, or university of publication
- _region_: [Region](/docs/region) that the citation group is published in
- _target_: Reference to another citation group; used if the citation group is an
  alias for another
- _archive_: Name of the archive in which articles from a journal can be found (e.g., "JSTOR")
