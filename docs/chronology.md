# Chronology

This page describes the geochronological timescales used in the database.

The global geologic time scale (GTS) follows [Gradstein et al. (2012)](/a/Geology-GTS2012.pdf). Several chapters provide detailed data about provincial biostratigraphic zonations, including [Vandenberghe et al. (2012)](</a/Paleogene_(Vandenberghe_et_al._2012).pdf>) for the Paleogene (chart on p. 882) and particularly [Hilgen et al. (2012)](</a/Neogene_(Hilgen_et_al._2012).pdf>) for the Neogene (chart on p. 938).

Where possible, localities should be assigned to units in a continental biostratigraphic system, such as North American Land Mammal Ages in [North America](/r/North_America) and MN zones in [Europe](/r/Europe). Such systems make it easier to place comparable localities within the same context. The alternative is usage of the GTS, but it is primarily based on the marine record and sites yielding terrestrial vertebrates generally cannot be correlated directly to them. However, marine sites, including those yielding marine mammals, should be dated using global stages/ages, not the continental mammal age systems. The continental age systems based on land mammals generally apply only to the [Cenozoic](/p/Cenozoic) except in North and South America, where land mammal ages are also recognized for some of the [Late Cretaceous](/r/Late_Cretaceous).

I extend the GTS with "Early", "Middle", and "Late" subdivisions of the Cenozoic epochs like the [Early Miocene](/p/Early_Miocene), as in [McKenna & Bell (1997)](</a/Mammalia_(McKenna_&_Bell_1997)>). However, usage of the formal stages/ages is preferred.

## North America

The 23 North American Land Mammal Ages (NALMAs) form a continuous, mostly well-documented sequence from the ?[Santonian](/p/Santonian)-?[Campanian](/p/Campanian) [Aquilan](/p/Aquilan) to the [Late Pleistocene](/p/Late_Pleistocene) [Rancholabrean](/p/Rancholabrean). (One, the "[Edmontonian](/p/Edmontonian)", is not formally recognized because its fauna is insufficiently documented.) The NALMA sequence was reviewed in the excellent volume by [Woodburne (2004)](</a/North_America-biostratigraphy_(Woodburne_2004).pdf>). [Appendix I to Janis et al. (2008)](/a/North_America_Tertiary-localities.pdf) provides an extremely useful compendium of North American Tertiary localities with their age assignments. [Hilgen et al. (2012)](<Neogene_(Hilgen_et_al._2012).pdf>) pp. 943–944 provides a brief review with some updates. [Gunnell et al. (2009)](/a/Wasatchian-Uintan-biochronology.pdf) reviewed the latest [Wasatchian](/p/Wasatchian) through [Uintan](/p/Uintan) ages and formally defined most of the biozones in that interval. They rejected the "Br0" zone in favor of [Br1a](/p/Br1a) and split Ui1 into [Ui1a](/p/Ui1a) and an informal [Ui1b](/p/Ui1b).

The Cenozoic NALMAs are further divided into zones with names that consist of an abbreviated version of the name of the age plus a number, such as "[Pu1](/p/Pu1)" for the first zone of the [Puercan](/p/Puercan) NALMA. These are defined, with varying degrees of rigor, in the 2004 volume. In addition, "subages" such as the [Graybullian](/p/Graybullian) are in use for a few of the Eocene NALMAs. The [Rancholabrean](/p/Rancholabrean), the [Duchesnean](/p/Duchesnean), and the Cretaceous NALMAs remain undivided, although [Wilson (2014)](/a/Montana_Cretaceous-Paleocene.pdf) informally proposed "La1" and "La2" assemblages within the [Maastrichtian](/p/Maastrichtian)-age [Lancian](/p/Lancian) NALMA.

The 2004 volume did not settle on a single set of zones for the [Blancan](/p/Blancan) and [Irvingtonian](/p/Irvingtonian) ages, but cited several previous schemes. Subsequently, [Martin et al. (2008)](<Rodentia_Kansas_Meade_Blancan-Irvingtonian_(Martin_et_al._2008).pdf>) suggested shifting the base of the Irvingtonian to the first appearance (FA) of [_Microtus_](/t/Microtus) in the Meade Basin, about 2 Ma, instead of the appearance of [_Mammuthus_](/t/Mammuthus) at about 1.35 Ma. [Hilgen et al. (2012)](</a/Neogene_(Hilgen_et_al._2012).pdf>) p. 938 formalized the Blancan and Irvingtonian subdivisions as zones Bl1-2, Bl3-4, Bl5, Ir1, and Ir2-3.

Based on [Hilgen et al. (2012)](</a/Neogene_(Hilgen_et_al._2012).pdf>), I use the following operational definitions for the Blancan through Rancholabrean:

- [Bl1-2](/p/Bl1-2): FA [_Mimomys_](/t/Mimomys), ~4.9 Ma
- [Bl3-4](/p/Bl3-4): FA _Pliopotamys_ (=[_Ondatra_](/t/Ondatra)), ~4.1 Ma
- [Bl5](/p/Bl5): FA [_Synaptomys vetus_](/t/Synaptomys_vetus), ~2.5 Ma
- [Ir1](/p/Ir1): FA [_Microtus_](/t/31338), ~2.0 Ma
- [Ir2-3](/p/Ir2-3): FA [_Microtus meadensis_](/t/Microtus_meadensis), ~0.8 Ma
- [Rancholabrean](/p/Rancholabrean): FA [_Bison_](/t/Bison), ~0.3 Ma

## South America

The South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA) sequence spans the Cenozoic, with an informal extension into the Late Cretaceous in the "Alamitian" SALMA. However, there are significant gaps between SALMAs, many early SALMAs are based on very few faunas, and even the relative position of some SALMAs has been uncertain.

The most recent comprehensive review of the sequence was by [Flynn & Swisher (1995)](</a/South_America-SALMAs_(Flynn_&_Swisher_1995).pdf>). Updates since then have included:

- [Kay et al. (1999)](</a/Barrancan-age_(Kay_et_al._1999).pdf>) provided evidence that the [Barrancan](/p/Barrancan) SALMA is Late Eocene in age, not Early Eocene as previously supposed. [Woodburne et al. (2014)](</a/South_America_Eocene-timing_(Woodburne_et_al._2014).pdf>) and [Krause et al. (2017)](</a/Chubut_Itaboraian-Vacan-ages_(Krause_et_al._2017).pdf>) provided further updates to Paleocene and Eocene ages.
- [Tejedor et al. (2009)](/a/Chubut_Laguna_Fria,_La_Barda_Sapoan.pdf) described a fauna from the interval between the [Riochican](/p/Riochican) and the [Vacan](/p/Vacan), which has been informally referred to as the "[Sapoan](/p/Sapoan)" ([Goin et al., 2012](/a/Greniodon_nov.pdf)).
- [Flynn et al. (2003)](/a/Tinguirirican_nov.pdf) formally proposed the previously informal [Tinguirirican](p/Tinguirirican) SALMA.
- [Dunn et al. (2013)](</a/Chubut_Gran_Barranca-age_(Dunn_et_al._2013).pdf>) updated the ages of the SALMAs represented at Gran Barranca ([Barrancan](/p/Barrancan)-"[Pinturan](/p/Pinturan)"). This sequence includes the [El Nuevo](/l/El_Nuevo) fauna, which appears to be intermediate between the [Barrancan](/p/Barrancan) and [Mustersan](/p/Mustersan), and the [La Cantera](/l/La_Cantera) fauna between the [Tinguirirican](p/Tinguirirican) and the [Deseadan](/p/Deseadan). For the latter, the informal name "Canteran" is occasionally used (e.g., in [the supplement to Dunn et al., 2013](</a/Chubut_Gran_Barranca-age_(Dunn_et_al._2013)_(supplement).pdf>)).
- [López (2010)](</a/Divisaderan_(Lopez_2010)>) established that the previously recognized "Divisaderan" SALMA was based on a mixed fauna, combining elements from the ?[Vacan](/p/Vacan) and the Early Miocene.
- [Cione & Tonni (1995)](</a/Uquian_(Cione_&_Tonni_1995).pdf>) rejected the [Uquian](/p/Uquian) SALMA because its stratotype is unsatisfactory and proposed the Marplatan instead. -[Cione & Tonni (2005)](</a/Buenos_Aires_Chasicoan-Platan-biostratigraphy_(Cione_&_Tonni_2005).pdf>) provided a review of the biostratigraphy of Buenos Aires Province, which is the region where most of the youngest SALMAs are typified.

I previously wrote a review of the Paleogene SALMAs [here](https://quip.com/zMYtA3Z9tP7h/South-American-Paleogene-mammals).

## Europe

The European system comprises a sequence of 15 European Land Mammal Ages (ELMAs), which in practice are not widely used, and a more granular sequence of "zones", the MP zones of the Paleogene and MN zones of the Neogene.

The MP zones are numbered [MP1](/p/MP1-5) through [MP30](/p/MP30). Much of the Paleocene is very poorly represented in Europe, and it is assigned to an undifferentiated "[MP1-5](/p/MP1-5)". Later in the sequence, [MP8-9](/p/MP8-9) is ranked as a single zone and [MP17A](/p/MP17A) and [MP17B](/p/MP17B) are separate zones. I do not have copies of many of the papers that defined the sequence, but [Schmidt-Kittler (1990)](</a/Europe_Paleogene-MP_zones_(Schmidt-Kittler_1990).pdf>) provides a brief review and [Schmidt-Kittler (1987)](/a/Europe_Paleogene-MP_zones.pdf) lists localities assigned to each zone. The MP zone is mostly in use in western Europe, but some Oligocene Turkish localities have also been assigned to MP zones.

The MN zones start at [MN1](/p/MN1). Correlation charts such as the one in [Hilgen et al. (2012)](</a/Neogene_(Hilgen_et_al._2012).pdf>) p. 938 continue the sequence to [MN19](/p/MN19) (Middle-Late Pleistocene), but [MN17](/p/MN17) (correlated to the [Gelasian](/p/Gelasian)) is the youngest MN zone that sees significant use in practice. [Hilgen et al. (2012)](</a/Neogene_(Hilgen_et_al._2012).pdf>) discuss the different approaches that have been used to conceptualize and define the MN zones. I intend to follow the Interval Biochron-based approach, which more closely agrees with the system used in North America. [Mein (1990)](</a/Europe_Neogene-MN_(Mein_1990).pdf>) and [De Bruijn et al. (1992)](</a/Europe_Neogene_(de_Bruijn_et_al._1992).pdf>) provide reviews of the MN system, including lists of localities assigned to each zone. MN zones have been widely used elsewhere in the Old World, as far afield as China (e.g., [Sun et al. (2018)](/a/Gansu_Wushan_MN6-8.pdf)). This is reasonable for western Asia (particularly Turkey) and northern Africa, which had faunas that were intimately connected with those of Europe, but should be avoided elsewhere.

## Asia

A system of Asian Land Mammal Ages (ALMAs) has been proposed on the basis of the faunas of China and Mongolia, but there are many variations in the literature and the system is not as widely used as the NALMA and MP/MN systems. ALMAs are very rarely used outside of eastern Asia (China and Mongolia).

For the Paleogene, I follow the timescale in [Vandenberghe et al. (2012)](</a/Paleogene_(Vandenberghe_et_al._2012).pdf>). [Wang et al. (2018)](</a/China_Paleogene_(Wang_et_al._2019).pdf>) review the Chinese record and provide useful historical context. They rename some ALMAs to names based on Chinese rather than Mongolian faunas, apparently in order to create a purely Chinese system. I use the more widely recognized ALMA names. Useful sources include [Ting et al. (2011)](/a/Asia_Paleo-E_Eocene-chronology.pdf), which provides chronology and faunal lists for the [Shanghuan](/p/Shanghuan) through [Bumbanian](/p/Bumbanian) ALMAs, [Li & Ting (1983)](</a/China_Paleogene_(Li_&_Ting_1983).pdf>), which lists Paleogene localities in China with their faunas, and [Russell & Zhai (1987)](</a/Asia_Paleogene_(Russell_&_Zhai_1987).pdf>), a thorough review of Paleogene mammals in all of Asia

The Neogene ALMAs in [Hilgen et al. (2012)](</a/Neogene_(Hilgen_et_al._2012).pdf>) are based largely on [Qiu & Li (2003)](</a/Rodentia_China_Neogene_(Qiu_&_Li_2003).pdf>). [Deng et al. (2018)](</a/China_Neogene_(Deng_et_al._2019).pdf>) and [Qiu et al. (2013)](/a/China_Neogene-stages.pdf) split the early part of the [Baodean](/p/Baodean) into the [Bahean](/p/Bahean) ALMA, replace the Pliocene [Yushean](/p/Yushean) ALMA with new [Gaozhuangian](/p/Gaozhuangian) and [Mazegouan](/p/Mazegouan) ALMAs, and add a [Nihewanian](/p/Nihewanian) ALMA for the Pleistocene. These changes are followed here, except that the Gaozhuangian and Mazegouan are interpreted as subages of the Yushean. The [Wang et al. (2013)](/a/Asia_Neogene-biostratigraphy) volume reviews many aspects of biostratigraphy in Asia. In particular, [the introduction](</a/Asia-biostratigraphy_(introduction).pdf>) provides a correlation of Neogene faunas across all of Asia. A more fine-grained system of NMU zones is sometimes used (e.g., [Deng, 2006](/a/China_Neogene-biochronology.pdf)), but most reviews do not use these zones and they are not adopted here.

The ALMA system is based exclusively on the faunal succession in China and Mongolia and it is rarely applied to faunas outside this area—probably rightly so because faunas in other fossiliferous parts of Asia tend to be rather different from those of China and Mongolia. Faunas in Turkey are often dated using the MN system. In South Asia, which has a very complete record, ALMAs are virtually never used; for the Neogene, [Barry et al. (2013)](/a/Punjab_Potwar_Mio-Pliocene.pdf) instead presented a comprehensive correlation to the global magnetostratigraphic time scale.

## Africa

A sequence of African Land Mammal Ages (AFLMAs) was recently proposed by [Van Couvering & Delson (2020)](/a/Mammalia_Africa-AFLMAs.pdf). This sequence is used in the database. Previously, [Seiffert (2010)](/a/Africa_Paleogene-chronology.pdf) provided an overview of the Paleogene, as did [Werdelin (2010)](/a/Africa_Neogene-chronology.pdf) for the Neogene.

## Australia

[Megirian et al. (2010)](/a/Australia-land_mammal_ages.pdf) recently proposed a sequence of six land mammal ages for Australia (AuLMAs), starting with the Oligocene [Etadunnan](/p/Etadunnan). These have not been widely used and do not provide high resolution, but they were listed by [Hilgen et al. (2012)](</a/Neogene_(Hilgen_et_al._2012).pdf>). For the important Riversleigh sequence, [Arena et al. (2016)](/a/Queensland_Riversleigh_Oligo-Miocene-chronology.pdf) provided a separate set of local biozones. Another useful resource for Riversleigh is [Archer et al. (2006)](/a/Queensland_Riversleigh-faunas.pdf), which provides faunal lists for all sites. There appears to be little direct evidence for correlating the Riversleigh biozones to the GTS. In their [supplementary material](</a/Australia-land_mammal_ages_(supplement).doc>), Megirian et al. (2010) criticize previous Riversleigh biostratigraphies, but comparison with the later and more detailed zonation in [Arena et al. (2016)](/a/Queensland_Riversleigh_Oligo-Miocene-chronology.pdf) suggests that faunal zones [A](/p/Riversleigh_Faunal_Zone_A) through [C2](/p/Riversleigh_Faunal_Zone_C2) correlate to the [Wipajirian](/p/Wipajirian) AuLMA and [C3](/p/Riversleigh_Faunal_Zone_C3) and [D](/p/Riversleigh_Faunal_Zone_D) correlate to the [Camfieldian](/p/Camfieldian) AuLMA.

## Local zones

Some places have well-established local biostratigraphic zonations that are not part of any continentwide schemes. A few of these are recognized in the database, including the [Karoo assemblage zones](/p/Karoo_assemblage_zones) (Permian–Triassic of South Africa), [Paraná Basin assemblage zones](/p/Paraná_Basin_assemblage_zones) (Triassic of Brazil), and [Riversleigh faunal zones](/p/Riversleigh_faunal_zones) (Oligo-Miocene of Australia).

## Future coding work

- We should automatically synchronize max_age between parents and children; e.g., the max_age of the Phanerozoic and Paleozoic
  should be synchronized with the base of the Cambrian.
- We should remove all usage of "next" and "min_age", since units are primarily defined by their base, not their top.
- Make sure all max_ages match GTS2012.
- Consistently avoid informal subdivisions that coincide with a stage/age, such as the Late Eocene (=Priabonian).
