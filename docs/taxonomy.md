# Taxonomy

Taxonomy is the branch of biology that concerns itself with the classification of
organisms. It is distinct from nomenclature, which covers the status and history of
names. Put simply, taxonomy decides what taxa exist and nomenclature decides what names
should be used for these taxa.

Most of the data in this database is about nomenclature: type specimens, original
citations, type localities, publication dates, etcetera. However, data about
nomenclature is more useful when it is placed in a taxonomic context.

Therefore, the database also comprises a full taxonomy of mammals (living and extinct)
to the species level, perhaps the most comprehensive work of its kind since
[Trouessart](/h/18851) (1898–1905).

This page discusses a few aspects of the taxonomy adopted here.

## General approach

This database is meant to be a compilation of published work, not a venue for new
taxonomic proposals. Therefore, the primary aim is to follow the current consensus in
the recent taxonomic literature. I do not necessarily follow the most recently published
taxonomic proposal. For example, I may stick with an earlier classification if the new
proposal is insufficiently motivated in my opinion; if it creates a logically
inconsistent classification; or if I simply want to wait to see if the new
classification becomes widely accepted.

However, in rare cases I may adopt an arrangement that has not previously been published
if it makes for a more logically consistent classification. For example, a recent study
split the Australian population of the sugar glider
[_Petaurus breviceps_](/t/Petaurus_breviceps) into three species, but did not address
the New Guinea populations previously assigned to _P. breviceps_. I chose to recognize a
species [_Petaurus papuanus_](/t/Petaurus_papuanus) for New Guinea sugar gliders because
a name is available and any other arrangement would be unsatisfactory. I also sometimes
introduce subgeneric classifications (subgenera and species groups) that are based on
published evidence but have not been formally proposed; such classifications help me
organize very complex genera.

Earlier in the development of the database I was less circumspect about introducing my
own taxonomic opinions into the database, and there may be some remaining cases where
the classification used is not supported by the literature. I will gradually clean up
such cases.

## Privileged sources

I give special deference to the taxonomy used in major reference works that are assumed
to represent the consensus of the community; I will generally adopt their classification
unless newer evidence points another way. Such sources include:

- [McKenna & Bell (1997)](/a/9784) for fossil mammals, the most recent compilation of
  its kind but now quite out of date
- [Wilson & Reeder (2005)](/a/9291) ("MSW 3") for extant mammals, which is the main
  basis for the classification of extant mammals in this database, but is now getting
  dated
- The _Mammals of Africa_ series (2013) for extant mammals of Africa
- _Mammals of South America_, Volume 1 ([Gardner (2008)](/a/5818)) and 2
  ([Patton et al. 2015](/a/25268)) for extant mammals of South America, which is
  exceptionally thorough in matters of nomenclature
- The _Handbook of the Mammals of the World_ ("HMW") series (2009–2019) for extant
  mammals, although its taxonomic decisions are not always fully explained
- [Rhodin et al. 2021](/a/57132) for extant turtles
- Darrel Frost's online
  [_Amphibian Species of the World_](https://amphibiansoftheworld.amnh.org/) for extant
  amphibians

## Ranks and phylogenetic nomenclature

Taxonomic ranks are among the most prominent aspects of Linnaean classification, but
they have become controversial as many argue that ranks are arbitrary and should be
abandoned. I acknowledge that ranks are arbitrary and inconsistently applied, but I find
that ranks are useful in practice as an organizing tool. For example, on the page for
each name on this website I list the class, order, and family for the name in order to
place it in context. However, the database also supports unranked taxa, and I freely use
those where they have been proposed in the literature. There are about a dozen unranked
taxa between [Saurischia](/t/Saurischia) and [Aves](/t/Aves), for example.

Another aspect of phylogenetic nomenclature is the use of formal definitions for taxa
(e.g. "all taxa more closely related to Species A than to Species B"). I record such
definitions in the database but at the moment I do not apply them directly.

## Subspecies

Many extant mammals include numerous named subspecies, the extreme being
[_Thomomys bottae_](/t/Thomomys_bottae) with over 150.
[Musser and Carleton (2005)](/a/8562) highlighted that in many cases traditional
subspecies are not taxonomically informative with the current state of knowledge, and
therefore they generally declined to recognize subspecies within Muroidea. I have
recognized subspecies in more cases where they appear in recent literature, but I am
sympathetic to Musser and Carleton's position and in the future I intend to err on the
side of not recognizing subspecies where the evidence is equivocal.
