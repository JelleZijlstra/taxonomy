# Geography

In the database, all localities are labeled with the geographical region they are in. We use
a system that is largely based on political boundaries, aiming at giving precise geographical
information while using only stable, well-understood geographical names.

Type localities for extant species are listed only as the region they are in. Type localities
for fossils are listed as the specific localities, which are then associated with the region
they are in. If precise information is not available, fossil type localities may also be listed
in a general locality like "[Texas fossil](/l/Texas_fossil)" (indicating a fossil found somewhere in [Texas](/r/Texas), without
more precise geographical or stratigraphical information) or "[Morrison Formation (Colorado)](</l/Morrison_Formation_(Colorado)>)"
(indicating a fossil found in [Morrison Formation](/p/Morrison_Formation) strata somewhere in [Colorado](/r/Colorado), without more
precise information). If the precise location of a type locality is uncertain, it is coded as
the smallest unit that includes all possible precise locations. For example, if the type locality
may be either in [Mexico](/r/Mexico) or the [United States](/r/United_States), it is coded as "[North America](/r/North_America)". The location
"[Earth](/r/Earth)" is used where even the continent is not known.

The region system is also used for coding the physical locations of collections and the places
of publication of citations.

The system is primarily based on country boundaries. Overseas territories that are far from
their home countries, such as [American Samoa](/r/American_Samoa) or [Bermuda](/r/Bermuda), are also treated as countries.
Countries are grouped into continents
and subcontinents, largely following the United Nations geoscheme. These groupings are useful
because many type localities for old names are imprecise. An animal said to have come from
"Bengal" may have come either from modern [Bangladesh](/r/Bangladesh) or from the Indian state of [West Bengal](/r/West_Bengal)
(or even from some other Indian state); the use of the geoscheme's regions allows
us to code this type locality as "[Southern Asia](/r/Southern_Asia)", which is a bit more precise than "[Asia](/r/Asia)".

Within countries, we use further divisions where this is helpful for organizing location data
and where a practical system of divisions exists. We introduce these divisions for countries
that contain a large number of localities in order to make it easier to recognize groups of
similar localities. The subdivisions used should have well-defined and stable boundaries,
should be of a practical size, and should be commonly cited in the literature when describing
geographical areas. For example, the states of the [United States](/r/United_States) are a very good match: their
boundaries are extremely stable, there are not too many of them, and virtually every paper
describing a location in the United States will mention the state. On the other hand, U.S.
cities are not a good match: their boundaries change frequently, there are far too many
of them (about 30,000), and they do not even cover all territory.

The [UN geoscheme](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/) recognizes six continents:
[Africa](/r/Africa), the Americas, [Antarctica](/r/Antarctica), [Asia](/r/Asia), [Europe](/r/Europe), and [Oceania](/r/Oceania). We split the Americas into
[North](/r/North_America) and [South America](/r/South_America), for a total of seven continents. Below, we discuss the geographical
conventions for each continent in more detail.

Where the name of a region is shared, the name of the country is added in parentheses for
disambiguation. This affects Punjab ([province of Pakistan](</r/Punjab_(Pakistan)>) and [state of India](</r/Punjab_(India)>)), La Rioja
([province of Argentina](</r/La_Rioja_(Argentina)>) and [autonomous community of Spain](</r/La_Rioja_(Spain)>)), Jura ([department of France](</r/Jura_(France)>) and
[canton of Switzerland](</r/Jura_(Switzerland)>)), Distrito Federal (both [Brazil](</r/Distrito_Federal_(Brazil)>) and [Mexico](</r/Distrito_Federal_(Mexico)>) have one), Córdoba (province
of both [Argentina](</r/Córdoba_(Argentina)>) and [Spain](</r/Córdoba_(Spain)>)) and Georgia
(country and U.S. state). In the last case, the country is just "[Georgia](/r/Georgia)" and the state is
"[Georgia (United States)](</r/Georgia_(United_States)>)".

The arrangement of regions is purely for convenience within the context of the database and does not imply
or endorse any political view.

## [Africa](/r/Africa)

Africa is largely divided by country, grouped in the five regions (Eastern, Northern, Middle,
Southern, and Western) of the United Nations geoscheme. A few countries are divided in the database,
largely those consisting of multiple islands. Special cases are listed below:

### [Eastern Africa](/r/Eastern_Africa)

- The [Comoros](/r/Comoros) are divided into regions for the three main islands ([Anjouan](/r/Anjouan), [Grande Comore](/r/Grande_Comore),
  and [Mohéli](/r/Mohéli))
- The French overseas territories of [Mayotte](/r/Mayotte) and [Réunion](/r/Réunion) are treated as countries,
  as are the [British Indian Ocean Territory](/r/British_Indian_Ocean_Territory) and the [French Southern and Antarctic Lands](/r/French_Southern_and_Antarctic_Lands).
  The last is further divided into regions for its constituent islands: [Bassas da India](/r/Bassas_da_India),
  [Crozet](/r/Crozet), [Europa Island](/r/Europa_Island), [Glorioso Islands](/r/Glorioso_Islands),
  [Juan de Nova Island](/r/Juan_de_Nova_Island),
  [Kerguelen](/r/Kerguelen), [Saint Paul](/r/Saint_Paul), [Tromelin Island](/r/Tromelin_Island), and
  [Île Amsterdam](/r/Île_Amsterdam).
- Within [Mauritius](/r/Mauritius), the outlying island of [Rodrigues](/r/Rodrigues) forms its own region.
- Within the [Seychelles](/r/Seychelles), each island or atoll with a type locality gets its own region. So
  far, this includes [Aldabra](/r/Aldabra), [Mahé](/r/Mahé), [Praslin](/r/Praslin), and [Silhouette](/r/Silhouette_Island).

### [Middle Africa](/r/Middle_Africa)

- Within [Equatorial Guinea](/r/Equatorial_Guinea), the islands of [Bioko](/r/Bioko) and [Annobón](/r/Annobón)
  and the mainland area of [Río Muni](/r/Río_Muni) are regions.
- The islands of [São Tomé](/r/São_Tomé) and [Príncipe](/r/Príncipe) are separate regions within the country of
  [São Tomé and Príncipe](/r/São_Tomé_and_Príncipe).

### [Northern Africa](/r/Northern_Africa)

- The Spanish territories in or near Africa ([Ceuta](/r/Ceuta), [Melilla](/r/Melilla), and the [Canary Islands](/r/Canary_Islands)) are
  treated as part of [Spain](/r/Spain) within [Southern Europe](/r/Southern_Europe), but as separate regions.
- The [Western Sahara](/r/Western_Sahara) is treated as a country.
- The [Hala'ib Triangle](/r/Hala'ib_Triangle), a territory disputed between [Egypt](/r/Egypt) and [Sudan](/r/Sudan),
  is treated as a separate region. Remarkably, three rodents have their type localities in this area.

### [Southern Africa](/r/Southern_Africa)

- The [Prince Edward Islands](/r/Prince_Edward_Islands) are treated as a separate region within
  [South Africa](/r/South_Africa). South Africa
  has very high biodiversity and well-established provinces, so the provinces are likely to
  become regions for the database in the future.

### [Western Africa](/r/Western_Africa)

- The British overseas territories of [Saint Helena](/r/Saint_Helena), [Ascension](/r/Ascension),
  and [Tristan da Cunha](/r/Tristan_da_Cunha) are treated as countries within Western Africa.

## [Antarctica](/r/Antarctica)

Antarctica covers all land south of 60°S. As it has no administrative subdivisions (for obvious
reasons) and little biodiversity (for equally obvious reasons), it is not
divided further for the purposes of the database. However, a number of fossil sites are known
in Antarctica, many on islands off the Antarctic Peninsula, so a division into regions may
eventually turn out to be useful.

## [Asia](/r/Asia)

Within Asia, a number of countries are divided further, and there are a few regions covering
multiple countries. See the section on Russia for related discussion.

### [Central Asia](/r/Central_Asia)

No special cases.

### [Eastern Asia](/r/Eastern_Asia)

- China is divided into regions for each of its provinces, autonomous regions, province-level
  municipalities, and special administrative regions.
- [Taiwan](/r/Taiwan) is treated as a country.
- In addition to the regions for [North](/r/North_Korea) and [South Korea](/r/South_Korea), there is a
  region for [Korea](/r/Korea) as a whole, to accommodate old type localities that are not specific.

### [Southeastern Asia](/r/Southeastern_Asia)

In the [Philippines](/r/Philippines), each island is its own region.

[Malaysia](/r/Malaysia) is divided into regions for [Sabah](/r/Sabah), [Sarawak](/r/Sarawak),
[Labuan](/r/Labuan) (a federal territory), and
[Peninsular Malaysia](/r/Peninsular_Malaysia) for all of the states on the Malay Peninsula.

There is a separate region for [Borneo](/r/Borneo), to be used for type localities that do not specify
whether they are in the Malaysian, Indonesian, or Brunei part of Borneo.

[Indonesia](/r/Indonesia) is an exceptionally complicated case as it is a transcontinental country comprising
many biogeographically distinct islands, three of which are shared with other countries. For
each of these three islands ([Borneo](/r/Borneo), [Timor](/r/Timor), and [New Guinea](/r/New_Guinea)),
there are separate regions that
can be used for type localities that specify only the island. Indonesia is listed as part of
Southeastern Asia, but the eastern part is geographically in Oceania, and the regions for Timor
and New Guinea are listed as part of Oceania.

Within Indonesia, the provinces on each major island form a region. The provinces outside of the
major islands are largely treated as separate regions, but some are grouped. Some islands within these
regions are also treated as separate regions. In the future, we will likely create a region for each province.
In more detail:

- The region of [Sumatra](/r/Sumatra) comprises the island of Sumatra and all islands belonging to provinces with
  territory on the island. A number of offshore islands or island groups are separate regions within the Sumatra
  region: [Banyak Islands](/r/Banyak_Islands), [Batu Islands](/r/Batu_Islands), [Enggano](/r/Enggano), [Nias](/r/Nias),
  [North Pagai](/r/North_Pagai), [Siberut](/r/Siberut), [Simeulue](/r/Simeulue), [Sipora](/r/Sipora),
  and [South Pagai](/r/South_Pagai).
- The provinces of [Bangka-Belitung](/r/Bangka-Belitung) and [Riau Islands](/r/Riau_Islands), which comprise
  islands between Sumatra and Borneo, are each separate regions.
- The Indonesian part of Borneo with its offshore islands forms the region of [Kalimantan](/r/Kalimantan).
- [Java](/r/Java) forms a region with its associated islands. The islands of [Bawean](/r/Bawean) and
  [Madura](/r/Madura) and the [Kangean Islands](/r/Kangean_Islands) are subregions.
- The island of [Bali](/r/Bali), which is coterminous with a province, is its own region.
- The region of [Nusa Tenggara](/r/Nusa_Tenggara) comprises the provinces of West and East Nusa Tenggara, which cover
  the island chain east of Java. The islands of [Flores](/r/Flores), [Lombok](/r/Lombok), [Sumba](/r/Sumba),
  [Sumbawa](/r/Sumbawa), [Alor](/r/Alor), [Rote](/r/Rote) (Roti), and [Savu](/r/Savu) are subregions,
  and there is another subregion for [West Timor](/r/West_Timor), the Indonesian part of the island of Timor.
- [Sulawesi](/r/Sulawesi) with its associated islands is another region. There are subregions for
  [Miangas](/r/Miangas), the [Sangihe Islands](/r/Sangihe_Islands), [Siau](/r/Siau), and
  the [Talaud Islands](/r/Talaud_Islands).
- The region of the [Moluccas](/r/Moluccas) comprises the provinces of Maluku and North Maluku. There are subregions
  for a number of islands: [Ambon](/r/Ambon), the [Aru Islands](/r/Aru_Islands), [Batjan](/r/Batjan),
  [Buru](/r/Buru), [Halmahera](/r/Halmahera), the [Kai Islands](/r/Kai_Islands), [Morotai](/r/Morotai),
  [Obi](/r/Obi), [Seram](/r/Seram), the [Sula Islands](/r/Sula_Islands), [Ternate](/r/Ternate), [Tidore](/r/Tidore),
  the [Tanimbar Islands](/r/Tanimbar_Islands), and the [Banda Islands](/r/Banda_Islands).
- The Indonesian part of New Guinea with associated islands forms the region of
  [Western New Guinea](/r/Western_New_Guinea). The
  offshore islands of [Biak-Supiori](/r/Biak-Supiori), [Japen](/r/Japen), and [Waigeo](/r/Waigeo) form subregions.

### [Southern Asia](/r/Southern_Asia)

- The Line of Control between [India](/r/India), [Pakistan](/r/Pakistan), and [China](/r/China) in
  the Kashmir region is treated as the border.
  Type localities that are given as just "Kashmir" are arbitrarily assigned to the
  Indian territory of [Jammu and Kashmir](/r/Jammu_and_Kashmir).
- [India](/r/India) is divided into regions for each of its states and union territories.
- [Pakistan](/r/Pakistan) is divided into regions for its provinces and other administrative units.

### [Western Asia](/r/Western_Asia)

- [Turkey](/r/Turkey) as a whole, including its European portion, is listed as part of Western Asia.
- The region of [Cyprus](/r/Cyprus) comprises the entire island of Cyprus. There is also a region for
  [Akrotiri and Dhekelia](/r/Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia), which could be used if we locate any records
  that are definitely from the territory of the Sovereign Base Areas.
- [Georgia](/r/Georgia) includes South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The name "Georgia" refers to the country, not the
  [U.S. state](</r/Georgia_(United_States)>).
- [Azerbaijan](/r/Azerbaijan) includes Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh).
- For the purposes of the database, "[Israel](/r/Israel)" includes land within the pre-1967 borders of the State
  of Israel, "[Palestine](/r/Palestine)" comprises the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights are part of
  [Syria](/r/Syria). However, sources are often not precise in this contentious region, so perhaps an alternative
  subdivision system should be used.

## [Europe](/r/Europe)

### [Eastern Europe](/r/Eastern_Europe)

- The UN geoscheme recognizes [Russia](/r/Russia) as part of Eastern Europe, but geographically
  most of Russia is in Asia. Accordingly, type localities that may be either in the Asian part of
  Russia or in another Asian country should be listed as "[Asia](/r/Asia)", and type localities that may be
  either in European Russia or in an adjacent country should be listed as "[Europe](/r/Europe)" or
  "[Eastern Europe](/r/Eastern_Erurope)" (if the adjacent country is also classed as Eastern Europe).
- [Russia](/r/Russia) is further divided into regions for each of its federal subjects (republics, oblasts,
  krais, etc.).
- Crimea is considered as part of [Ukraine](/r/Ukraine), not Russia. Ukraine also includes the Donbass
  region.
- [Moldova](/r/Moldova) includes Transnistria.

### [Northern Europe](/r/Northern_Europe)

- [Denmark](/r/Denmark) does not include the [Faroe Islands](/r/Faroe_Islands) and Greenland,
  which are listed as separate countries
  (in Northern Europe and [Northern America](/r/Northern_America) respectively).
- [Svalbard](/r/Svalbard) and [Jan Mayen](/r/Jan_Mayen) are listed as separate regions within
  [Norway](/r/Norway).
- The [Isle of Man](/r/Isle_of_Man) is listed as a country.
- [Guernsey](/r/Guernsey) and [Jersey](/r/Jersey) are listed as countries, the latter including
  its dependent islands of Sark, Herm, and Alderney, which are not themselves treated as regions.
  They are all grouped in a region called "[Channel Islands](/r/Channel_Islands)".
- The [United Kingdom](/r/United_Kingdom) is divided into regions for each of its four constituent
  countries: [England](/r/England), [Wales](/r/Wales), [Northern Ireland](/r/Northern_Ireland),
  and [Scotland](/r/Scotland). The UK has a large number of fossil localities, especially
  in England, so England and Wales are divided further into regions for each of the
  [vice-counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice-county) that are
  traditionally used for biological recording in the UK. The
  [British Bryological Society](https://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/bbs/Recording/vcmappage.htm) has a good map of the
  vice-counties. In the future we may add vice-counties for Scotland and Ireland.
- The UK's overseas territories are listed as separate countries in other continents (or, in the
  case of [Gibraltar](/r/Gibraltar), in another part of Europe).
- Type localities that are given as "Ireland" are listed under the country of [Ireland](/r/Ireland),
  even if technically they may have come from Northern Ireland.

### [Southern Europe](/r/Southern_Europe)

- [Gibraltar](/r/Gibraltar) is listed as a country.
- [Kosovo](/r/Kosovo) is also listed as a country. At least four mammals have their type localities in the
  territory of Kosovo.
- The administrative regions (peripheries) of [Greece](/r/Greece) are listed as regions.
- In [Italy](/r/Italy), the 20 regions are listed as separate regions in the database.
- Within [Portugal](/r/Portugal), the [Azores](/r/Azores) and [Madeira](/r/Madeira) are listed as separate regions.
- Within [Spain](/r/Spain), the autonomous communities are listed as regions, as are [Ceuta](/r/Ceuta)
  and [Melilla](/r/Melilla). Most
  communities are further divided into provinces, but the two insular communities are divided into
  their major islands instead. For the [Balearics](/r/Balearic_Islands), this means [Formentera](/r/Formentera),
  [Ibiza](/r/Ibiza), [Mallorca](/r/Mallorca), and [Menorca](/r/Menorca), and for the [Canary Islands](/r/Canary_Islands),
  [El Hierro](/r/El_Hierro), [Fuerteventura](/r/Fuerteventura), [Gran Canaria](/r/Gran_Canaria),
  [La Gomera](/r/La_Gomera), [La Palma](/r/La_Palma), [Lanzarote](/r/Lanzarote), and [Tenerife](/r/Tenerife).

### [Western Europe](/r/Western_Europe)

- Within [Austria](/r/Austria), the states are listed as regions.
- Within [Belgium](/r/Belgium), the provinces and the [Brussels-Capital Region](/r/Brussels-Capital_Region)
  are listed as regions.
- Within [France](/r/France), the departments are listed as regions. The two departments of
  [Corsica](/r/Corsica) are
  united into a single region. The various overseas territories and departments are listed
  under other continents.
- Within [Germany](/r/Germany), the states are listed as regions.
- The Caribbean islands that are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are not listed as
  part of the [Netherlands](/r/Netherlands), but as separate countries within the [Caribbean](/r/Caribbean). The provinces
  of the European part of the Netherlands are listed as regions.
- [Switzerland](/r/Switzerland) has a region for each of its cantons.

## [North America](/r/North_America)

### [Caribbean](/r/Caribbean)

In accordance the UN geoscheme, the Caribbean includes some island groups that are
technically outside the Caribbean Sea, such as the [Bahamas](/r/Bahamas). In addition to a number
of independent countries, this region includes dependent territories of the Netherlands
([Aruba](/r/Aruba), [Curaçao](/r/Curaçao), [Bonaire](/r/Bonaire), [Saba](/r/Saba),
[Sint Maarten](/r/Sint_Maarten), and [Sint Eustatius](/r/Sint_Eustatius)), France
([Guadeloupe](/r/Guadeloupe), [Martinique](/r/Martinique), [Saint Barthélemy](/r/Saint_Barthélemy),
and [Saint Martin](/r/Saint_Martin)), the United Kingdom ([Anguilla](/r/Anguilla),
[British Virgin Islands](/r/British_Virgin_Islands), [Cayman Islands](/r/Cayman_Islands),
[Montserrat](/r/Montserrat), and [Turks and Caicos Islands](/r/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands)) and the United
States ([Puerto Rico](/r/Puerto_Rico) and the [United States Virgin Islands](/r/United_States_Virgin_Islands)).

There is a region of [Hispaniola](/r/Hispaniola) covering the whole islands, so that we can accommodate
records that may come from either [Haiti](/r/Haiti) or the [Dominican Republic](/r/Dominican_Republic).

A few countries include subregions for individual islands:

- [Antigua and Barbuda](/r/Antigua_and_Barbuda) is divided into regions for [Antigua](/r/Antigua),
  [Barbuda](/r/Barbuda), and [Redonda](/r/Redonda).
- [Saint Kitts and Nevis](/r/Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis) is divided into regions for the islands of
  [Saint Kitts](/r/Saint_Kitts) and [Nevis](/r/Nevis).
- [Trinidad and Tobago](/r/Trinidad_and_Tobago) is divided, you guessed it, into regions for
  [Trinidad](/r/Trinidad) and [Tobago](/r/Tobago).
- Within [Grenada](/r/Grenada), the administrative dependency of
  [Carriacou and Petite Martinique](/r/Carriacou_and_Petite_Martinique) is
  listed as a separate region.
- Within [Saint Vincent and the Grenadines](/r/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines), the island of
  [Saint Vincent](/r/Saint_Vincent) and the [Grenadines](/r/Grenadines) island chain
  are separate regions.

### [Central America](/r/Central_America)

Although [Mexico](/r/Mexico) is not usually included in Central America, the UN geoscheme does list
Mexico as part of this region.

The states and the [Distrito Federal](</r/Distrito_Federal_(Mexico)>) of Mexico are separate regions for the purposes of
the database.

Within [Honduras](/r/Honduras), the [Swan Islands](/r/Swan_Islands) group forms a separate region.

### [Northern America](/r/Northern_America)

This awkwardly named region includes the [United States](/r/United_States), [Canada](/r/Canada),
[Greenland](/r/Greenland), [Bermuda](/r/Bermuda), and [Saint Pierre and Miquelon](/r/Saint_Pierre_and_Miquelon).

Within [Canada](/r/Canada), the provinces and territories are listed as separate regions.

The [United States](/r/United_States) is divided into the states and the
[District of Columbia](/r/District_of_Columbia). The overseas
territories are listed as separate countries in the Caribbean and Oceania. The various
minor outlying islands (Navassa Island and a number of islands in the Pacific) are not
currently listed because the database does not include any records from them. If necessary they
will be added as separate country-level regions within the Caribbean and Oceania.

In the database, most U.S. states are further divided into counties, which provides a uniquely
detailed level of coverage—as of this writing, more than two thirds of all regions in the database
are U.S. counties. This is achievable because descriptions of type localities in the U.S.
usually include the county name, and county boundaries are fairly stable over time.

Within the U.S. there are a few special cases:

- [Louisiana](/r/Louisiana) is divided into parishes instead of counties.
- Several states (notably [Virginia](/r/Virginia)) have some cities that are not part of any county. These
  are also treated as regions for the purposes of the database.
- [Alaska](/r/Alaska) does not have counties; its equivalents are called boroughs instead. However, the
  boroughs do not cover the entire state, and the remaining area (the "Unorganized Borough",
  which covers more than half of the state) is divided only into "census areas" for the
  convenience of the U.S. Census Bureau. There are numerous type localities in Alaska, but
  much of the taxonomic literature predates the establishment of local governments, so the
  boroughs are not as good a fit for the database as counties are in the rest of the U.S.
- [Hawaii](/r/Hawaii) is divided into counties, but these are not currently listed as regions in the
  database. Creating regions for each island would make more sense, but so far this has
  not been necessary because Hawaii has very few indigenous vertebrates except for birds.

## [Oceania](/r/Oceania)

We do not currently use the UN geoscheme's division of Oceania into Australia and New Zealand,
Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. In addition to independent countries, Oceania includes
dependent territories of France ([Clipperton](/r/Clipperton), [Wallis and Futuna](/r/Wallis_and_Futuna),
[New Caledonia](/r/New_Caledonia), and [French Polynesia](/r/French_Polynesia)),
the United Kingdom ([Pitcairn Islands](/r/Pitcairn_Islands)), the United States ([Guam](/r/Guam),
[Northern Marianas](/r/Northern_Marianas), and [American Samoa](/r/American_Samoa)), and New Zealand
([Cook Islands](/r/Cook_Islands), [Niue](/r/Niue), and [Tokelau](/r/Tokelau)). These are all treated as countries.

A few countries are divided further:

- [Australia](/r/Australia) is divided into its states and territories, including the outlying territories of
  [Christmas Island](/r/Christmas_Island), [Cocos Islands](/r/Cocos_Islands),
  [Heard Island and McDonald Islands](/r/Heard_Island_and_McDonald_Islands), and [Norfolk Island](/r/Norfolk_Island).
  The outlying islands of [Lord Howe](/r/Lord_Howe_Island) and [Macquarie](/r/Macquarie_Island) are
  separate regions within their states ([New South Wales](/r/New_South_Wales)
  and [Tasmania](/r/Tasmania), respectively).
- [New Zealand](/r/New_Zealand) includes regions for the outlying [Antipodes](/r/Antipodes_Islands),
  [Auckland](/r/Auckland_Islands), [Bounty](/r/Bounty_Islands), and [Campbell Islands](/r/Campbell_Islands).
- Within [Papua New Guinea](/r/Papua_New_Guinea), there are regions for the 20 provinces, the
  [Autonomous Region of Bougainville](/r/Bougainville_Region), and the
  [National Capital District](/r/National_Capital_District). There is another region for the island of
  [New Britain](/r/New_Britain), which is divided into two provinces.
- Within the [Solomon Islands](/r/Solomon_Islands), there are regions for the major islands of
  [Choiseul](/r/Choiseul), [Santa Isabel](/r/Santa_Isabel), [Malaita](/r/Malaita),
  [Makira](/r/Makira) (San Cristobal), [Guadalcanal](/r/Guadalcanal), and [Rennell](/r/Rennell).

There are regions for the islands of [Timor](/r/Timor) and [New Guinea](/r/New_Guinea) to cover type
localities that do not specify the country.

## [South America](/r/South_America)

In addition to independent countries, South America includes [French Guiana](/r/French_Guiana),
the [Falkland Islands](/r/Falkland_Islands) (Malvinas), [Bouvet](/r/Bouvet), and
[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands](/r/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands).

A few countries contain further divisions:

- [Argentina](/r/Argentina) is divided into regions for each province.
- [Brazil](/r/Brazil) is divided into regions for each state and the [Distrito Federal](</r/Distrito_Federal_(Brazil)>).
  Within the state of [Pernambuco](/r/Pernambuco), the outlying island of
  [Fernando de Noronha](/r/Fernando_de_Noronha) is a separate region.
- Within [Colombia](/r/Colombia), we recognize regions for each department and for the city of [Bogotá](/r/Bogotá).
- Within [Ecuador](/r/Ecuador), the [Galápagos Islands](/r/Galápagos_Islands) are a separate region.

## The oceans

Although the database deals primarily with continental taxa, a few marine groups are also
covered. Even marine taxa often have coastal type localities that are easily assigned to
a continental region, but some type localities are in the open ocean. This includes some
fossils that were dredged up from the sea. For these, we
have additional regions that cover the world's oceans.

Ideally the boundaries of the oceans should follow those specified by the International
Hydrographic Organization (IHO), an international organization setting standards in
hydrography. However, the most recent (3rd) edition of the IHO's _Limits of Oceans and Seas_
publication currently dates from 1953. A draft 4th edition was circulated in 2002, but
not published due to intractable disputes over the name of the sea between Korea and Japan.
The 3rd edition is problematic because it did not recognize the (now widely accepted)
Southern Ocean and because it defined the oceans as excluding their various marginal
seas. Therefore, we follow the boundaries set in the draft 4th edition, which is
available [here](http://wiki.geosys.ru/lib/exe/fetch.php/ru/portal/lib/iho/s23.los.ed4draft.2002.pdf).
